Suicide. I think about suicide every day. Been thinking about it for the past 2 years. I always come to the same conclusion that I'm either too afraid to bear the consequences or too certain that I still have something to give to reap the rewards.,"Do you know the author Tom Robbins? He recently wrote a memoir. In it, he said Everything can change completely at any moment. This is still the best argument I know against suicide. You still have plenty of life to reap, I guarantee it. What you're going through is temporary, even if it's been a long time, even if it seems like there's no end in sight. You're going to be ok."
"I hate when people say that when I kill myself, I will hurt people that love me. My family doesn't really love, it is clear to me from how they treat me in regards to being transgender. It seems there is just 1 person who cares about me and messages me every day, but they live far away.","Thanks for sharing that. I agree that telling people that they shouldn't kill themselves due to their loved ones can sometimes be futile and useless. You must be going through so much with the world being unready to accept you yet. Just know there are people who do accept you for who you are. Whether it's the friend that lives far away from you or any person that read your post and identified with your story. You, staying alive and sharing this would also do wonders for trasgenders who have trouble being accepted by their families or close ones. Depression causes us to feel helpless and unloved. Slowly finding ways to treat yourself will give you more reasons to keep going. There are transgender communities that you can also communicate with on the internet. Take care of yourself please."
"Does anyone notice a change in libido during extended episodes of depression?. I have depression, and with me, I either lose my sex drive altogether or get extremely aroused nigh constantly. Is this a side effect of depression? Is it recommended to indulge these impulses or does it lead to other high risk behavior?","Now this is an odd one. I felt a drop in my sex drive when my depression worsens, but sometimes I can be really sad and then have morning wood and whatever. I am no professional by any means, but I feel it differs from person to person."
"I don’t have the ability to cry anymore. No matter how sad or upset I feel, I can feel that the urge to cry is there but I physically cannot. I just want to be able to cry and let off some steam but the feelings just bottle up and make me even more upset.","I experienced smth similar during the last two years. Before I went to hospital because of depression I was crying a lot and almost everyday. After my therapy was over I met my first girlfriend and then, again I cried from time to time in her arms. After she broke up with me two years ago I didn't manage to cry a single time until now. I'm not so sure about it, but I guess it's all about the heart and to heal it from within and not from the surface..."
Do happy occasions make anyone else feel more suicidal and depressed?. I'm currently at my cousin's wedding and everyone is having a great time but I'm sitting here just wanting to end it all. I'm probably not going to experience my own wedding so I'm trying to enjoy this but for some reason I'm subconsciously not letting myself.,"I always see couples and hate them. Not because I am a bad person (or maybe I am), but mostly because of why I don't have anyone. I've come to the conclusion that people are so shit on everything that they shouldn't be allowed to reproduce. Every single one I've met is always doing stuff for himself/herself. EVERYTHING people do is for personal benefit, nowadays. From the way people start approaching others to the way people break up. * Wanna get a girlfriend? BETTER FIND ONE IN TINDER!. Yeah, let's all start liking some stupid slut's photos that will help you get laid and of course it will NEVER inflate her ego to think she Pretty and successful with men, while in fact she is a nobody to everybody. * Wanna take a girl on a date? BETTER USE MY PARENTS' MONEY TO SHOW I'M A MAN!. If the best thing you have to offer to the opposite sex for them to appreciate, is money that aren't even yours (and for them to like you) why the hell are you allowed to have children? We don't any more of you ass***s running around. I understand that what I am saying might seem over-dramatic to some of you(or all of you) but let me tell you some thinks about me: I am 27, I graduated the university after studying there for 8 years because I had to work and serve my conscription to the army, I've lived(and still am) my whole life with my mother because we were too poor to have a separate house, haven't found a job since I graduated because the financial crisis has ravaged my country and I feel like I have little will and reason to live anymore. I wish something happened and people couldn't have sex for over a year. Only then would society come to the place it was supposed to be. Too many sluts and too many rich kids doing shit they want."
"Am I alone because I'm depressed, or am I depressed because I'm alone?. It's been so long, I don't remember anymore...",The capacity for love can't be built in isolation.
Ok here's the deal. My emotional state is describable like this: Either I feel shit or I don't feel anything at all. An right now i don't feel anything. If you ask me its better that way. Need some fucking rest from this bullshit.,"Is there not any thing that makes you feel good? I know that it may not seem like it, but think hard about it. There has to be something in your life, big or small, that makes you feel in a good way. For me I felt like I couldn't have any good emotions. Only bad ones. I sat down one day and really thought about my life. When I'm with my friends I usually can feel good. Most of all my little brothers are what bring me true joy and happiness. I took hold of this and I try to spend time with them the best I can, and sometimes I won't because I'm in a state of self pity, but I'll realize what I'm doing and pull myself out of my bed and spend some time with them. It always helps me. I understand how you feel, but there has to be at least one thing that makes you feel in a non hurtful way. It may not come right away, but I'm sure you'll think of something if you really try hard. Best of luck."
"I need to stop questioning.. I keep questioning everything about who I am and what people think of me on a daily basis. I want to say that I'm in solitude but I'm painfully alone. I ask myself these self reflective questions and end up feeling trapped, if I could; I would jump into a new body and try to restart. I can only distract myself for do long... EDIT: I just wish I could be told that everything is alright sometimes. Maybe I would stop being such an empty she'll of a person.",Do you think you care too much?
"im so sad and i have no idea why. fuck this, fuck life, fuck everything",Something's not right up there. Have you seek treatment?
"Depression is a bitch. This is my first day of vacation and I'm breaking down in the bathroom. Seriously, fuck this. Why can't I enjoy not even one day of my life.","Just to say I was totally in that place at the start of last week when I went on holiday. Had a massive cry and a big old panic and then made it all worse by beating myself up with it/being all like SHOULD BE HAPPY, WHY ARE YOU NOT HAPPY. I AM ANGRY THAT I AM NOT angry just makes more sad and a nasty cycle. Know that allowed to feel how you feel, and okay to go on holiday and feel like crap. I hope things start to feel a bit better and you get some relaxing in."
Most people can't conceive that not killing yourself is a conscious decision every day for some of us. I wish we could all just wake up happy,"I have a fairly normal life but I think about killing myself on a daily basis. Nothing really engages me anymore, and it hasn't for a very long time. Maybe I've just not found something I like. More likey I feel I can't be myself for whatever reason and have to pretend to be something or somebody else to fit in. It's incredibly cliqued I know but that's how I feel. I know that eventually I will kill myself it's really just a matter of when rather then if"
"How do you deal with the pit of despair in your chest?. Personally, I like to look through hundreds of homeless dogs that I can't adopt until I can't take it anymore. Of course this only make me want to cry but it directs the pit and gives it propose a I can go to sleep.","Yeah, this feeling is a strong one. Felt it consistently for a lot of my childhood and early adulthood. The truth is that I never dealt with it constructively, or at least in a way that could help me get to the root of that feeling. Part of the reason I think you and I are on this in the first place is because we were never taught how to deal with that feeling constructively. In my case, I used constant denial and self-numbing ... At some point, I just assumed the pit was a part of me I could choose to ignore. You seem to be actively trying to experience it. You are engaging your sadness, which is objectively good for working through depression. It may not be what you might call 'conventional' but everyone does their thing a little differently :) If what you are doing no longer works for you though, it might be best to start looking for other (healthy) ways of working through that discomfort. Personally, when I feel that pit, I know what thoughts tend to follow it. Fortunately, my therapists (and my stay at hospital) helped me come up with ways to attack that pit when it hit me hard. In order to redirect those thoughts that create it, I try to reach out to anyone in my support net. It's hard because I feel like they won't give a shit, but most of the time, they do (but I often choose to ignore that reality). Or I will simply write some positive words here, on this. Reaching out to others here in positive ways is not just for others, but for my own sake as well. As you put so well, giving that pit a 'purpose'. But don't cover that feeling up. Continue to engage with it, as best as you can. It's there for a reason. Hopefully, the more you work with it, the easier it is to process and let go."
Flopping on social medias can be kinda depressing. I have 30 Instagram followers. How to get more?,"Why is that depressing? You should not let the amount of followers determine how you feel, especially not to this extent. It is not a reflection of what you are worth nor how successful your life is. Even if you would get more followers, what would this solve? You would not even know who most of those people are. I also doubt that an illusion like this could provide anyone with actual happiness. And Instagram has a pretty messed up algorithm anyway, I would personally not even bother."
I always push away the people I like because I act defensive and become unapproachable due to my anxiety....fml. Im going to die alone yay. I am unlovable.,"Last year I started dating the love of my life without a single doubt in my mind. My depression resurfaced tho and I started to push her away right into another man's dick. The worst part is that you can't exactly warn them about how you're really feeling and the reason why you're pushing them away because it's hard for them to understand, potentially making everything way more complicated. I don't know enough about you but I know that my heart is fragile so I put up a wall around me to protect it. But sometimes i open up a hole in the wall and it can be pretty darned beautiful.. or disappointing. Luck, maybe?"
God being alone sucks. not just taking about being single. Actually living alone... :/,"Maybe you can find a room mate or something ? Idk what type of housing you live in (e.g. apt., house, renting, etc.) but that may help cut monthly expenses in some way too if that's something you're looking for. Maybe get a pet if your housing accommodations allow it. Pets really help with loneliness and depression sometimes. People can even actually get their pets registered as official emotional assistance animals. In some cases, they will be allowed to live in certain housing areas in which pets would otherwise not be allowed. Sometimes it's easy to focus on the negative of living alone. But there are tons of good things about it as well. You just gotta look towards those as well."
I need help in seeking help. I've only today managed to try emailing samaritans but even then its from an anonymous account. How do I speak to others about my problems? How do I stop hiding? I dont have friends or family I would like to share this with.,"I went to the doctor and told her my problems, I got redirected to a therapist and she helped me a lot."
"Depressed. I am depressed as hell, what to do?",Depends on what you want to do. Be rid of it? Or get better at handling it? Did it come out of nowhere? Or have you had it for a while?
I feel jealous of all you people that are still young and depressed. You still have time to turn it around.. I on the other hand don't. It's over for me. The loss of hope is a terrible thing.,I used to think that way at that age. Then I hit 35... 36... 38... every time I said fuck it I'm halfway done why bother. Don't fall into that trap.
"Depressed. I am depressed as hell, what to do?",Depends on what you want to do. Be rid of it? Or get better at handling it? Did it come out of nowhere? Or have you had it for a while?
I see a red door and I want it painted black.. I want it all to be black,"No colors anymore, I want them to turn black I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes I have to turn my head until my darkness goes..."
... : \. That about sums it up.,Elaborate my friend. We're here to help.
"I did the dishes today. It isn't a huge feat, but after 5 days of sitting around I finally did something to clean my house up.","Awesome! That's a success in my book. :) I managed to call someone and spoke to an actual human being about my car yesterday, now if only I could set up all the other appointments I need to lol. Keep doing small things like that, it helps you feel like you've accomplished something especially when they start to pile up after a bit. Maybe eventually we'll be productive right?"
"This Halloween I went as no one and went nowhere. No costume, no parties, no outing. Didn't get invited anywhere because I have no friends. I didn't even get any trick or treaters. Just stayed home alone. Woo.",me too... no one invited me to anything. and not one trick or treater either! i have been eating all the butterfinger minis. how are you?
I don't know.. I just don't know anymore.,"I know that feeling. If you want to talk about it, I'm here. Feel free to message me if you like."
Fuck Everything. If god existed then depression wouldn't.,Depression is hell. I feel ya.
"Does willingly refuse to take care of myself/willingly not avoid bad habits count as self-harm. Cause if it does, I do self harm.","Ya know it's funny, i've never cut, I rarely drink, have never been drunk, don't smoke(anything), only use prescribed meds. All my self harm is the kind that can be disguised as independent issues, like bad diet, lack of exercise, poor hygiene, too much time on my computer. I guess I don't want people to worry,"
"I thought about paying an escort just to have a conversation. It's a good idea, don't even lie","Whaddup Holden! Also that's what a therapist is for, they just don't dress as sexy and wont blow you while you cry"
"I hate sleepless nights. I just think about shitty things in my life until I find a way to stop being sober so I can sleep. I just got desperate enough to drink marsala and nearly threw up from stomach pain. Oh well, hopefully I can sleep now.","I'm sorry you're feeling unwell. I can't sleep either. I've been having a couple nights of unrest. I hope you're having better luck than I am. Also, stay strong. I know it's hard and it's a long journey but the fact that you want to stop is a start. Sleep well."
"I don't see the point in having friends. All they do is bore me and cause anxiety when I think about them. And yet, I still feel lonely.. I hate this so much. I'm a shit person.","I think I can relate to what you're saying. I feel like a big part of my depression is loneliness. I can't make friends. I want friends but even when I put myself out there, I can't say anything. It's like my mouth is taped shut. Makes me uncomfortable so I leave. Then I feel lonely, then I try to put myself out there... the whole cycle starts again. I've tried sports clubs, and other extracurriculars. I guess I just wasn't meant to have friends."
Is anyone else incredibly funny irl but miserable af when they get home?. What kind of jokes do you do? Who knows what you really feel inside? Why do we rely on other people's happiness?,"It's fucking weird. I often have to bring every ounce of willpower up to bring myself to go to a party with frends, even though I know it will be good. But once I'm there, I'm often the Life of the Party, or so I think. I had people coming up to me, greeting me by my name and telling me how much fun they had last time we had met each other. Which was a year ago. For the first and last time since. I barely remembered their faces and not a single name. So I guess I left an impression. I really like to banter, to do play on words and take words from their mouth and turn them around in a fun way. I joke and tell stories with expressive facial expressions and big gestures. I'm sarcastic, sometimes even cynical. And I joke a lot about myself, mostly in a non-flattering way. I think people like me in general, I seldomly had someone outright refuse to interact with me. But on the other hand, as soon as I come home, I feel a crushing void and I feel alone and that everything is pointless. Those feelings remain in my day-to-day life. And it starts to interfere with my work, for example. I am not one to contain my feelings in an enviroment where I spend most of my days and life in. My boss already told me once, in a pretty long phase of being really depressed, that even my collegues said that something must be seriously wrong and the have no fun working around and with me if I'm in such mood. I can be fun at work, too. I made my co-workers laugh on a lot f different occasions. But that happens in good phases. But there are very bad phases where I, at best, don't say a single word all day unless absolutly necessary and at worst, I am filled with rage the whole day and can't contain it. Last week I was as close to quitting my job as I was never before. Maybe it would be best for all.  Whatever, long story short: I think I can be really funny, too. Despite the fact I feel fucking miserable inside or do not feel anything at all."
"Trying to think of something good to say about nm. Aother than nice views and the canyon road walk, and I love my dance class. This might take a while",Instead of trying to think of something good why not set out to make something good. Doesn't have to be major just something small each day
Depression and politics.. Hey everyone. Would a person with depression ever make a good politician? Maybe even a leader?,"Abraham Lincoln had kind of a messed up life and was depressed for much of it, even being put on suicide watch for a while."
"I always feel so lonely, even though I have a few friends, and I have my family.. Is it just depression kicking in? Or what the heck could I be feeling?",I feel exately the same and killing me (Sorry for bad english)
"Should I tell my mom I tried to kill myself today?. I feel like I owe that to her, but I don't want to break her heart...",Do it. You'd break her heart more if you actually go through with it.
I don't think people understand how it feels to want to to die every minute of everyday.. And that sleep is a substitute for it.,"Inactivity is the cause for depression and depression causes inactivity. Seek to get out of your cycle, bit by bit."
"Fuck this shit I'm ready to go. Grim Reaper, take me away.. I have no one. Goodbye.","Hang in there. It'll be better, I promise."
TIL being depressed on your period is not a good combination. Didn't even think twice about hurting myself.,Pms is THE WORST. Im a darn psycho majorly depressed freak for a week then bleeding and cramps for a few days. Pregnancy is 9 months of PMS. Men cant understand..they just cant
I’m a fucking failure. FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK,Same I feel like I have failed to reach every goal I have set for myself. Although I kinda just accepted it at this point and stopped caring that I always fail and it strangely helps me get not so depressed about it anymore.
i'm living in hell. hey how about we make some people in the world question everything and make them cry but let's never ever give them an answer to anything and let's make them wish they were dead and let's create horrible diseases and depression because we're fucking sadistic jerks! how about that. -life,Let there be struggles that people face so they can gain strength and have confidence when they overcome.- life
"Just saw a drug commercial that said, Who wouldn't want to live longer?. I think that would be awful rn.",Yep. (Don't think there's anything else to say)
has anyone here taken cymbalta? I'd love to ask you some questions. So I'm prescribed cymbalta and I'm terrified of serotonin syndrome. Someone said that flu like symptons are a sign of that. I had flu like symptoms when I took the medication. Anyone else?,"It is just your brain playing games, from a single med it is kinda impossible to get that syndrome, if you take like huge amount for a long time and different medicine together maybe you will get sick, otherwise it is not likely at all, please dont worry :) it is really very hard to achieve that"
"No longer feeling emotions. For the past few months I was feeling very depressed every day but last Saturday I woke up and my sadness was gone but so were all other emotions, does anyone know what disorder this is called?","Flattened affect, usually caused by SSRI meds"
I feel so empty.... and I don't know what to do...,"What would you like to do? Hugs, hope things become better for you soon! :)"
Instead of cutting I scratch myself until I bleed.. I don't like knifes. My parents think I self cannibalize. I need to stop but I can't.,Does it hurt more than cutting?
"Where do you go when home doesn't feel like home. Please, please take me away from this place...","Yes. had better nights sleep in my car than my bed sometimes. Find a secluded spot, read a book/watch a movie, write in a journal."
I'm very tired. I think I'd just like to lie down,Same. I just want to sleep and never wake up.
Screaming. Does anyone else feel like they need to scream until they can't anymore but when you do it doesn't help fill the aching emptiness at all? Been dealing with this shit for 8 years and its torture,I want to let so much out.
Why do you always say 'Sorry' so much? What are you apologizing for?. Existing. Sorry I bother everyone by saying I'm sorry too much.,"Have you considered that maybe you say sorry sometimes when you should be saying thank you? Making this post into an example, instead of apologizing, you could thank people for tolerating how overly apologetic you are. Calling someone else kind and understanding is more constructive than putting yourself down."
"Today, I stood up in the shower for the first time in 5 months.. Life is about small victories.",wait... how does that work? You've been sitting in the shower?
"19th Birthday. How come every year when my birthday I cry so much at night, I just break down, I hate feeling like this, not being happy, but yeah, happy birthday to me",I remember it like it was yesterday. What a waste it was. I can't look at the photos knowing what was hanging over me. I'm so young and really had nothing to worry about. I wish I 'd got on with life
"How to help my depressed friend?. what to do? I dont want him to do something stupid, he doesn't want to go to any therapist since he had bad memories with one. What can I do to help him?","happy to hear you know your friend is depressed before it gets worse, Did he tell you? or can you just tell? If I were you try going somewhere or just go do something fun then bring up how noticed being abit off in a nice way? sure he get mad or nothing he would be happy to hear that your trying to help (from some who is depressed) then just talk to him and tell him your there for him, and how he can rely on you. sounds like you care so go help him man."
How do I apologize to my boyfriend for how I have been treating him?. I have been really mean to him and snapping at him for stupid and dumb things. I love him so much and I don't want to lose him. How do I make it up to him?,"ask another 5000 times on, that will solve the problem."
I start feeling better than before after 19 days with antidepresants....docter told me it took long to see difference but it started in 3rd week....what it indicate?. Does that mean that medicine will have good and more effect on me?,"everyones brain chemistry is different so it's going to have differing effects at differing times for everyone. The doctor can't really say for sure because science doesn't even really know how or why the drug truly works. It's just a general rule that they have to tell you is to give it at least 6 weeks or so. Not surprising at all that it has made you feel a lot better at 3 weeks, that's when it usually kicks in for me as well. And yes they are designed to build up in your system over time. So it should keep on getting better for 6 months or so (with diminishing increases over time) for it to be at full strength. But again everyone is affected a little differently. Source: have been on many anti depressants for almost a decade."
Why do I feel good right now?. It has been years since I actually felt joy where I wasn't worrying about something because of my constant anxiety. It feels surreal and I want to hold onto it but I know I will feel like shit tomorrow again.,"See if you can build on it. Maybe go out and do something you've never tried. I know i'm not the one to talk because I don't go anywhere haha. But since you feel good, it might be worth trying something new and building on it?"
"I'm not willing to kill myself.. Tempted to hire someone to off me, though.",Is it sad that one of the biggest reasons I haven't killed myself yet is anticipation for future games?
Is anyone happy?. I just want someone to say that they are happy. That life is worth living. I'm having trouble seeing that as a real thing right now.,"*raises hand* Nope, I'm not happy. Sorry if I was supposed to say something different, but I try to tell the truth. Some of thes I visit make me feel less lonely, because I identify with the people who contribute content there. I often get depressed, and I'm hoping that lurking here at r/depression will help me find new ways to deal with it, by learning from the other people here. That's why I subscribed here today. A lot of people find part of their meaning for life in other people. Maybe that's why communities like this help, I don't know."
I'm depressed because I procrastinate all the time. I procrastinate because I'm depressed.. Seems like an unbreakable cycle.,I agree that procrastinating makes you more depressed and that being depressed makes you procrastinate more. There is definitely something of a vicious cycle going on. But don't give up trying to break the cycle. What sorts of therapies and things have you tried? Hope this helps
I just don’t want to live. I want to die I want to give up I want to run from everything I want to let go I take this responsibility to make something out of myself,What responsibility? Why is that a responsibility. Did someone give it to you?
"I'm gonna smoke my last hit of weed, try to feel happy, probably cry. I have $14 in my bank account",That's terrible. I can understand the struggle they must be. This world is not sustainable for a lot of people.
Are there any methods to coping with depression and suicidal thoughts that actually works?. Emotional support does nothing for me yet I see it everywhere. I think many of us need some real help,"Depression isn't something you can get rid of by wishing it away or telling someone you have it. A lot like an addiction you have to fight to get out of it. And it's hard to tell what path is right or wrong. Talking to people does help. But you need to find someone you can talk to. I couldn't talk to my mom for the life of me, my sister would tell my mom or tell me I was wrong, my dad just gave me a look and didn't know what to say besides he cares about me. Once my mom knew the extent of my depression she became better at helping me. She listened and didn't judge. She let me talk and told didn't lecture but reassured my decisions. She went out of her way to make me feel more confident. That's the person you need to find. Also try writing your feeling down whatever you feel on a peace of paper what ever is on your mind. Write it in chicken scratch don't worry about how ty write just write what you feel. Then throw the paper away. That used to help me, not as much as my mom did but I did help. Life isn't something we can live alone although a lot of us want to, I wish I could, find someone to confide in that supports you."
"I'm starting to think my girlfriend is part of my imagination. Just thinking about her seems fake. Idk how to describe it, like when I think about what we did it doesn't feel real. Idk why. Something just feels off.",Maybe because you can't think of someone that might love you because you can't love yourself
Friends. Why did i push away my friends and wanted to be alone and be proud of being alone but get sad later on :/,"That's how depression works, darling. May I ask, are you on antidepressants? That might help you."
"Nobody cares if you're happy or not, they just want you to function.. That's what I realized today.",I do function and I functioned my whole life - I have a scholarship for my study program and am one of the best in my semester plus are part of the student representatives and more stuff and having a job. So everyone would agree that I'm working very well - but that doesn't mean that it ever goes way up or that I am close to anything like happiness - or that I ever was. So I can't agree with you. That people expect you to function just puts more pressure on you - it's not helpful.
Anyone else feel better when thinking about suicide?. I always feel better knowing that if anything gets too bad I could always kill myself.,How are you feeling now?
Anyone else feel disturbed at random times?. I feel like reliving a traumatic experience sometimes (even tho I really had one) and have a sense of hopelessness and fear in me. I have a lot of nightmares and depressing dreams and sometimes I wake up feeling sad and ill. This happen to another else?,"yes! so sorry that's happening to you, but it feels good to relate - I see a lot of posts about having great dreams. I have at least one bad dream almost every night - and the feeling *always* bleeds into my day, especially if it was confusing or made me question reality. I have dreams all the time about my little sisters getting hurt, and it makes me worry for them. just today I had some kind of sleep paralysis (I don't know if that's the right word, I looked it up but it didn't seem to fit) and honestly I'm scared to fall asleep tonight because I do not want it to happen again. it's happened several times and it terrifies me. you're not alone, friend."
Often times it seems that I choose to stay in sad situations/places and I don't know why I do this to myself.. I don't know why I keep doing this to myself.,Maybe because the devil you know is better then the one you dont. I would say maybe you're afraid of what may happen... so much that you would rather endure what you have rather than gamble. Any of this sound right? What bad situation are you in? Would you like to talk? I'm here if you do :) pm or reply on here :)
"Anyone else feels normal after getting really drunk?. Its like theres a part of my brain that's constantly generating negative thoughts and clouds my mind, and alcohol just shuts that part up.",Same. I wonder what my life could be like if I existed at the level I'm at after a few drinks.
1:45 am.... cannot sleep... how will I die in sleep if I don't sleep.... I hope I don't wake up Edit: 03:04 am,Sleep is the cousin of death. We sleep a third of our lives and we dont even fully understand why.
My depression affects others. I realized my depression makes those around me depressed too.,You know what that means? It means that you're an influence to others. People care about you and share the same feelings as you.
therapy. Im going to a therapist tommorow. And i dont know what to say,The therapist should do the job for you. think too much about it. Nice username by the way. Is it by any chance a reference to the song Mack the knife. Sorry for not giving you a longer answer. just way too tired to give a long response.
"It's be great if I had someone to comfort me during my worst times. But then I remember I'm just a hot mess of a person who has too many burdens and would bother others with them anyway. So all I have is venting online to strangers or holding it in. Either way, I don't feel better.","My dear, sometimes you've gotta learn to comfort yourself. I had to recently. All I wanted was someone to just be there and tell me everything is going to be ok. The one person I needed to tell me this, never came. You have to be your own hero. You are a strong human."
They say being active helps but I pull 18 hours days and all I can think about the whole time is dying. Being active changes nothing.. Just another lie to keep us here longer.,"Well being active *is* important, but so is not being overactive. 18 hour days, man? You can't do that for long. It's important to do something during the day so you have so.etbing to process at night."
"Emotionless or emotional. Which do you prefer? I think my meds are working too well because I haven't felt anything in a while, but what's worse? Feeling too much or not feeling anything.",What do you think? What are three major pros and cons of each for you?
Fuck everything. Fuck me fuck life fuck the world fuck everything,I know how you feel. Everything went to shit for me too.
When was the last time.... Someone gave you a hug?,"If you don't count my mother or family members, about 3 years."
"I'm so fucking tired.. I want to hurt myself, but I literally don't have the motivation to get out of bed to do that. So, yay I guess?",sorry. one of the shittiest feelings.
i'm dying. shaking and crying and struggling to breathe for hours.,Hang in there. Things can feel intolerable they really can. Can you try listening to your favourite music?
"Coworkers occasionally ask me if I'm okay. It's kind of embarrassing but sometimes I can't fake a smile while doing my job. And several people have noticed that I seem unhappy. It's hard to explain, but I'm guessing this has a negative impact on any advancement opportunities. I wish I was different.","Hey, i think for the upside of it, your coworkers are genuinely concern for your wellbeing which is nice. And if you're doing a great job at your work then there's still chances of promoting! Taking care of yourself comes first always!"
"I get so mad at my peers for having girlfriends whereas I'm getting nowhere with my crush that I feel like ruining their relationships with each other just to feel like life is fair. I try very hard to get one of my friends since 8th grade to date me but nothing happens. She's perfect for me and all these other people have fun with a significant other. The only joy I can get now is striking people down, but I don't know yet:(","my advice, dont fall in love with any one. Losing love is the worst feeling i the world. Just dont do it. Stop now while you can. You are better off alone."
"I love suffering. not lying. Life is too short to lie. I am peaceful, this depression will be the last. I want to sit and suffer, I want to get This is it",I feel you man. I think surpassed normal self harm. Now i not only hurt myself physically I hurt myself emotionally. I love to feel like shit. I like to want to die. When I look back at when I was closest to suicide i want to be back there. I want to be sitting on the verge of death again. What the fuck is wrong with
Lol. Im gonna die alone and,I feel the same way. Do you want to talk about it?
"mirtazapine increase to 30 mg after 2 days of 15mg?. i wonna take mirtazapine for adhd / lack of motivation / depression, so i thought 30mg in the morning would be nice. it has been only 2 days since i started from 15. can i already up to 30mg? what would be downsides?","Mirtazapine as far as I know is used for depression/insomnia typically. Not for adhd. I would ask your doctor about vyvance or another drug similar to that for your adhd... mirtazapine is perfectly fine to go from that dose to 30 in my opinion. It would be better if your body was introduced longer to the 15mg (2weeks) then bumped up to 30mg, but I see no complications or issues with being bumped up to 30mg this early in the game. Side effects of Mirtazapine are that it will make you tired, so the motivation and everything may be an issue with your adhd... Again look into vyvance. You may gain some weight also, that is a common side effect. Also some anxiety could occur, but that is rare. important to read up on your meds when you receive new ones. Or ask your doctor before you even get prescribed them."
Without music i wouldve killed myself. Listing to music help get away from life. Just being fully submerged in the music and listening to lyrics. Truely without it I don't know where my life would be.,I can totally relate to this. Do you mind sharing your playlist?
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. holy shit I'm a fucking mess,"I almost broke down crying just then for literally no reason. All of a sudden I started feeling anxiety - had to get up and walk around, knot in my chest, felt like a panic. Was super fucking close to texting my ex, only reason I didn't is because i know it would make me feel fucking shittier"
I feel so invisible.. I've never felt so invisible before in my life.,"i see you, youre real to me and if i were there you wouldnt be invisible ."
"I break down crying every day when I get home. I push it off at work and at school, but as the day goes on I can just feel it building and building. And then I just break.",does it happen for a reason?
Wait a minute parents are supposed to have unconditional love for their children?. Sign me up please! Oh wait :(,Check in with us! I hope we shed some light for you in there. Hugs.
I'm at the emptiness stage. I'm a mindless robot drifting through life doing what I have to do,"How is in your head? I mean... what thoughts go through it? I wonder if Im alone in this but..m my mins doesnt wander anymore. Im aware of every single thought, which is never pleasant nor spontaneous/creative. :/"
"I suspect I might have a form of depression or anxiety. If I get tested, will my insurance go up?. Does it depend on the results?",Because your depressed? It most certainly should not. Definitely get the help you need.
I feel like I'll never have a girlfriend because of my depression.. I'm 34 years old and never had a serious girlfriend. I don't think I'll ever meet someone and it scares me. My depression makes me tired all the time. Can anyone give me any advice?,"do you have any close friends? every friend i get i tell them they'll just leave me like everyone else and they do, because i'm just so overbearing to everyone i talk to. does it help you to at least talk about it? even for a bit i feel that talking about it helps, but i never find anyone to talk to because all i do is just talk about depressing things a lot, i hate myself cause of it and in the end i just hate myself more and more."
How do you reach out to someone without feeling guilty or ashamed?. Anytime ever tried to reach out to a friend I just get overcome with a feeling of guilt because not their problem. It makes me feel even smaller and I absolutely HATE being a burden on people. I just feel so alone.,"There's nothing wrong on reaching out people, you're just showing you like them, you like to be with them, so don't worry about it. Imagine someone texting you and saying Hey, how are you?... I miss you. Hows everything going? Doesn't feel good?"
I’m a fucking failure. FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK,Same I feel like I have failed to reach every goal I have set for myself. Although I kinda just accepted it at this point and stopped caring that I always fail and it strangely helps me get not so depressed about it anymore.
Question for people suffering. Does depression make you angry?. Do you lash out at people and call them names? Do you have episodes of rage and are you aware of your actions during them? How can I help someone who says they have depression but is not diagnosed?,"I do. I push people away, am very irritable out of nowhere even if someone says a certain word of phrase. I'm pretty shitty actually, but I can't stop :("
"Scrolling through old pictures and found a few of a mate who hung himself.. Title explains it, a bit sad rn :l",I cannot imagine how much pain leads somebody to suicide. God Bless
"Why can't suicide be easy ?. I feel like if suicide was painless and quick, I would have done it a long time ago.","I feel like it's a paradox. People would call you or I selfish, but who are they to assign life or the absence thereof. Many people can't relate to such feelings of loneliness and unworth. But for those who can, being called selfish for suicidal thoughts, makes it all the more confusing of a situation. It also shows you who really cares, cause calling you selfish is just choosing the victim route, for themselves, which is fucked. While some may call it manipulation. Whatever the name, it's hardly sympathetic, and isnt even close to empathetic. Which, empathy, is what this world is lacking. A partnership society would support each other regardless of their stance or tradition. But, we live in a male dominated, monotheistic world. People suck. The only thing we can do is help them. So that's why I think suicide is hard; you're not helping anyone."
What do you do every day when you're suffering depression?. I really wanna know how other people live their life. I know myself too much but have no clue what depression is like to others. Thanks.,"I tend to go back to sleep over and over, and I eat at dinner time. spend the nights playing video games and then I oversleep. I need a balance of alone time and time with friends to start feeling like myself again, and if I get that balance wrong I can meltdown. I tend to downplay my problems to the people around me and upplay them to strangers. For example, inflate things for the sake of a conversation with some crisis volunteer or something, just to get some free sympathy and support that I have to feel weird about later because I see that person again. But, if a friend asks me how doing, my first reaction is to reply I have good friends so they call me out on this. I self sabotage by missing appointments or shutting out natural light. If cold, thirsty, hungry or uncomfortable, I ignore it and let myself suffer. I know getting better when I start doing certain things for myself. If I make myself some tea or get more blankets or sit somewhere other than my bed, I tell myself because I care about myself and want to feel better. I have physical pain associated with depression, usually I feel an ache in my arms and legs. When I have the energy I stretch to alleviate it. This also helps me feel better. I have to be conscious of whether I have the energy to do something, because if I force myself I could get overwhelmed and just sink further down. had to learn to say no to people when what they ask of me is more than I can provide without suffering later. But, for the most part, learned my depression will leave when good and ready. been going downhill for two months and had a meltdown a few nights ago so been thinking a lot about what I really need to get through these times. These depressed phases tend to last 4-6 months for me so still got a long way to go. This my first rodeo, though, prepared. learned that there are plenty of little things I can do that feel like self care. Self care is not always an elaborate bath with essential oils and red wine. To me self care is getting up to make a cup of tea, spending a couple minutes stretching, or ordering food when hungry instead of waiting until everything is closed and starving. It have to make you feel better all at once, but all those little things add up, and it means more when you put conscious value on it. will stretch so my body hurt so much, and I do this because I care about feeling I say to myself. I meant for this to be short...... and then it Hang in there."
I feel like nothing matters anymore. But I'm too scared to go and its pathetic.. Why am I alive? I dont know. I shouldnt be.,It's okay not to be okay. A lot of us in this sub are in the same boat as you. You are not alone &lt;3
"Is anyone else just happy that other people are sad?. Not trying to be a dick, just asking",I'm just glad I'm not completely alone with these feelings like I convinced myself. I feel like I'm reading all the thoughts I've had my entire depression ridden life in clear text and it helps me process it better.
Everyone's having fun with their summer while I'm here hating life. I used to enjoy summer... Not anymore,Move to Australia. winter there
Anyone. Care to be support friends?,I'm new to idk how it really works. Is there like a friends list to add people or something?
"Anyone choose to be angry at times instead of feeling empty?. Meditate on something infuriating just to feel some fire? Some will. Ive tried to meditate on the positive things but its just empty, ridiculous. I feel worse about who I am for it but its the easiest out and quick relief. So am I the only crazy person here?",Yes. TESTOSTERONE AND ADRENALINE are SALVATION. My angryness expresses itself through deep dark sarcasm.
.. Feeling very suicidal right now.. I feel like hurting myself.,Hang in there. You are not alone. Tell me what's going on.
"I finally forced myself to get help. I fianlly forced myself to go to the doctor and told them that im in a deep depression and got alot of suicide thoughts. I'm now in a process to get psychologist help I feel proud, because i never really ask for this kind of help",Great Work!!! Wanted to tell you I too am proud of you. I saw someone as well after a last year. I am very proud of you and ever think there is anything wrong with seeing someone!
Have any of you ever ran away from home?. What was your experience like and how did running away affect your depression/behavior?,"I ran away two times as a teenager. One time I was gone for a couple of months. I only went back when I became physically ill and couldn't afford meds. I begged my parents to let me come home and buy my prescriptions. I had a terrible UTI and bladder infection. Going back home was terrible and good at the same time. I was sad to be home, my parents were angry with me and told me all the terrible things they believed about me while I was gone. Things they heard from other people and things I think they imagined. About 80% were completely untrue. I was a disappointment and a sinner. I was sad to be away from my boyfriend and glad to be away from him at the same time. He was considerably older than I and of course I had envisioned our life together as different. The second time I ran away I had a better plan partly. I took my clothes and anything else I could throw in my friends car and went to her house where she lived with her grandparents. The next morning I woke up to my Step Mom standing at my feet telling me to get up and come with her and Dad. I grew up very depressed, my Mother passed away when I was 2 1/2 years old, then my older sister passed away few years later. Every day I was sad. I didn't understand what happened, I didn't understand how something so terrible could happen and life changed drastically and in a flash. No one talked to me about any of it and I was broken. Walking to school in the morning, thru classes all day, walking home in the afternoon, having dinner, staring into the void during homework time, staring at the ceiling at night trying to go to sleep, I had a huge pain in my chest and I was alone."
"I’ve relapsed. sorry. I even wanna be here, but thought I could hold on. Instead I fucked it again.","Quitting is hard. I've never dealt with addiction in that way myself but I've dealt with those low points, the ones you think you can't come back from. Not to say that I'm perfect now or that I still don't get down but I reached out to those I care about and the amount of support was overwhelming. Have you talked to your fiance about how you're feeling?"
"What is the faster way to kill yourself?. im done with life , for me is hopeless to rewind everything",I'd say shooting yourself in head with a shotgun. But think about 'might happen' consequences. Your soul.. being born again.. idk isnt there really anything you can do about your desperate situation? Whats up man
"Driving. I drive fast. Not just 10 mph over the limit but fast fast. I like to take backroads and drive in both lanes and follow the racing line just on the edge of losing control. My friends understand. I even drive like I usually do with them, just faster than what should be normal. They always tell me to slow down and not drive so recklessly, and sometime I do, and sometimes I Honestly I really understand either. Maybe the only time I really feel alive. Maybe I want an opportunity to die in an accident. Whatever it is I probably need to stop. Any of you like this too?","I do this too, only when I'm alone in the car."
"Different week different feels. Does anyone go through weeks like that? One week I'm pretty content I wouldn't say happy exactly, just okay. And other weeks, oh my god other weeks are hell. This week is one of those weeks for me.",this next week is going to be one of those other weeks. just want to yell at the sky or something lol
i'll never be cute enough for the girl at school. i wish i had pale skin like her,"School fucking sucks. I'm closeted but I'm like 95% sure people can tell, which sucks because my dad hates gay people. I look and act reasonably masculine. It's just my fucking voice, I don't have the stereotypical lisp but it is pretty high and effeminate. I'm also pretty soft spoken and just a soft guy in general."
"you know what ,,,, i just want to die. i know people have it worse than me and people in houston have every single right to wish death upon themselves rather than me but oh my god i would give anything for someone to just break into my house and murder me.","Shit, my dude, other people will always have worse (or better) lives than us. That doesn't invalidate your pain. I look at it like this: As a kid, I would throw tantrums in the grocery store if my mom wouldn't buy my favourite cereal. A couple years later, I could handle that, but I cried when I got cut from the basketball team. A couple years after that, I was nearly suicidal when my girlfriend dumped me. I eventually learned to handle rejection, but full time work drove me to drug abuse. Now, I can handle working 50 hours a week. The point is I have always had terrible coping skills. None of my problems have ever been that bad, but they have been the biggest problem I ever faced. They always seem overwhelming because I don't know how to handle failure of rejection of really any kind of pain or even mild discomfort. I am a wimp. And yet, they still treated me at the hospital - multiple times. I was never told to suck it up; I was taken seriously and given the help I need. It isn't about the external circumstances, it's about how we react to them. So if you need help, *that's okay*. You aren't any less of a person. You are worth just as much as anyone else. Someone losing their home or family in Texas doesn't mean your problems are irrelevant at all!"
idk what’s worse. being alone or not wanting to be alone,Being alone is difficult. Honestly it helps to reach out. I reconnected with an old friend. We hadn't been in touch for couple years over a petty argument and a bad experience being roommates. Anyone in your life you could reach out to?
"Ready to get help, How the fuck do I do it?. I'm tired of feeling nothing, and dreaming of sticking a knife into my jugular. Do I call a doctor and say I need to be seen for depression? Go find some therapist then wait to be referred to a psychiatrist? Who do I call?","Here's the simplest way I can think of: 1- Go to your primary care doctor and report your symptoms of depression. Ask to be referred to a psychiatrist. If you can immediately see a psychiatrist, go for that. 2- Get into therapy, it really helps. Use psychology today to find good caregivers in your area. It really helps. I'm assuming you're living in the U.S., but regardless, I wish you the best of luck."
I'm ready. It's my own fault. I'm ready to go.,"What are your reasons? Let's talk. Part of you does not want to go. My guess is you feel you have nothing to live for, to grab onto in this life. Thus you posted on here hoping someone could change your view. (Maybe I'm wrong. Whatever. We can still talk.)"
Does anyone else get really anxious/paranoid that people don't like them?. I'm struggling with this lately :/,known my best friend for 15 years. never had any sort of falling out. We get along fine. She considers me her family. still expecting her to tell me hated me this entire time and has been making fun of me for 15 years by pretending to be my friend.
No one believes in me. Well today is the day even my parents dont even believe in me anymore. I dont believe in myself but they always did until now yay :),"I feel ya, don't worry about it, everything will be fine"
"?. I feel so lonely all the time. Like, not to sound fake deep, but I constantly feel like I'm sinking and I'm really afraid that I'll never find people I have a good connection with? I have friends and I love them but I'm still so so lonely and it hurts so much","If you don't mind, how old are you? How long have you been feeling like this?"
nothing is fun anymore.... ...it's just tolerable time filler.,Hi! Not even something little?
I really oftenly have intense depressive episodes w/ suicidal thoughts. I want help but I'm too scared to ask,"How old are you? Can you get an appointment with your primary doctor? Even a regular doctor can help you if you just talk to them. They can get you to the right place. I went through the same thing trying to tell my doctor something was wrong. It turned out he asked me. Sometimes they'll ask a generic have you been feeling down or helpless, have you had any suicidal thoughts etc. I think they're getting better at making it easier to talk about. It's worth a shot. Good luck."
I'm Really Fucking Sad. I'm angry and tired and I want a friend. I cant reach out to anyone. I've tried and it always ends up worse for me and the other person. I'm just really really sad.,"hey, do you need someone to talk to?"
"4:56am/8.29. 25. not sure when supposed to be doing. Even as I write this my eyes are too blurry to see. not sure who is reading this, But just know not okay.","I get it too. I slept in 3 nights, my mind is ablaze! having a really tough week too in my struggle with depression, but before this week, I had three really good weeks. Hang in there! Some days are just harder than others. Sometimes I try falling asleep to a meditation music playlist, sometimes that works for me, I can focus on the sounds instead of my thoughts. Just take it one day at a time and know that you are not alone! I hope tomorrow is a good day!"
I just watched my dad fucking wave a stick at my mom and threaten to beat her and shut her out of the room.. They were all friendly a few minutes later. What the fuck is wrong with people? I'm in a nightmare.,Everything is wrong with people.
Is it okay to be alone?. Where is the line drawn that defines introversion vs isolation?,When you're alone do you find that you can be content while also taking care of yourself or do you start to feel like you're slipping and increasingly become overwhelmed and unable to do daily things to take care of yourself? Sometimes it can be hard to understand what's going on inside and it helps to watch what you start doing/stop doing instead.
My depression is killing the vibe among my friends. Which is probably why I'm pushing people away...,"Let others suffer with you. The biggest struggle with depression is the isolation box it confines us in. It fools us into believing there is no one that will understand. Tells us not to burden others with our problems. Demands we keep our pain in the shadows. But this is the nasty cycle that keeps us locked in to our loneliness. We feel lonely, hate that we feel lonely, feel stupid for looking weak, and decide to keep it hidden. We find worth in our connection to others. Not because they decide if we are worthy or not, but simply because our ability to contribute what is in us is only useful in light of others. I'm not sure of your circumstances, but I can tell you that I have been in your shoes. I have felt completely cut off from the world. I have laid in bed night after night, wondering why I should even be here. I have been so lost and hard on myself that I couldn't even look at my face in the mirror. I have broken down in just about every room of the places I lived and expected it to never change. But it did. Not all at once. It took time. But when I began to open up to others and let them struggle with me and offer help. And by also helping others myself. It doesn't need to be family or current friends. Finding support is a hard thing these days. But there are great places now to get help working through the pain of living."
"Imagining my funeral. Does anyone else think about their funeral/ how people would react to their death? Not in a suicidal way, in fact it makes me feel better. Knowing that people would come to my funeral and actually care about my death feels comforting in a morbid way","Mine is more bitter, just knowing that people who ignored my suffering when I was alive would be there crying and screaming putting on a show for everyone else with crocodile tears... It high key disgusts me but I look forward to that day"
I fucking hate weekends. I'm always so anxious about the weekend coming because I know I'm going to be alone the entire time.,Make him take you to a movie or something

Nobody knows me anymore - not even my boyfriend. And nobody even tries. This is no way to live.,Why not try and get to know some of us? May help short term.
I'm so ready to die. There is nothing for me in this life,"but how can you play sims when you're dead? jokes aside, don't do anything okay, calm down. life will bring beauty, hang on."
"Told my friend I want to CTB. Literally just told him i wanted to catch the bus. He asked me what it meant and I said suicide, his response was Oh wow i haven't heard that term before and walked off. Lol fml","Wow, if you need to talk about it, you can DM me."
"is having an episode a reason to take a few days off?. Its never been as bad as right now, i detest myself. i honestly couldn't see me going to work like that tomorrow. so is that reason enough?",I think that avoiding work to sit at home in your misery is a bad thing. Getting out of the house is recommended even if it's something like going to work. Obviously do whatever you feel is best but I don't think skipping work is going to help you get any better. For example I could barely get out of bed this morning to go to work but even though I'm here hating it I would alternatively be at home sleeping until 2pm then lay in bed on my phone all day.
��. Sometimes I have the urge to cut but that's not even helping anymore I'm hanging on by thread,What's up buddy ? Want to talk ?
i've never carved a pumpkin. because i'm a friendless loser.,"Thought id check out the depression sub, well i have to go now"
"So the options are either dying in misery or living in misery, either will hurt others and either will be considered ones own fault. You can force someone to stay alive, or to die, but you can't force anyone to truly live, not even yourself. It's kind of an unfair expectation.","It is unfair. Modern psychology/psychiatry is completely incapable of helping those who are in severe pain with lifelong battles with mental illness. It often feels like we are just vehicles of pain who live so that others don't suffer from grief should we commit suicide. As we develop a greater sensitivity to the cost of mental illness, policies and social norms will change: Some countries now allow for euthanasia for those with chronic and unbearable mental illness. But what's strange about all of this is, even though I'm certain I have the right to kill myself because I'm miserable everyday, I am pulling for you to live, even though you're a stranger on the internet. I have hope for you and I don't even know you. I want you to wait it out, to battle it out, not because you owe me or anyone else, but because I think there might be something better for you in a day or a week or a decade from now. What have you tried so far to get some relief? Has anything worked? What can you do that brings you moments of enjoyment?"
"You can't be sad, you're always so happy.. It hurts so bad when people tell me this.",This is the sentence I fear the most. It's why I've never reached out to anyone.
I'm an honest guy but there's one thing I lie about all the time. Hey! Hi! How are you? **Good.**,We often ask that question out of habit and rarely out of genuine interest in the answer. It feels unnatural to say anything other than good or fine and we don't expect a different answer than that from anyone else. It's weird that we even ask when you think about it...
Everything is anything. good luck to you all with your gaming. but also fuck everyone. even though I hope you will find good things. not that those exist MAKE SURE TO CUT YOUR HAIR WITH YOU TOENAIL CLIPPERS,pugs are weird but pretty okay
People tell me to have positive thoughts.... but there's no positive thoughts to think about.,If a puppy isnt a positive thought I do not wish to live in your world.
"If pretty or better people can't find love, how can I pretend to get a SO?. I want to be loved by it makes me sad when I see better people than me not able to get a partner. So what's left for me? It makes me feel like shit. I'm just an ugly piece of shit who doesn't deserve it.",Yea I need to remember how to do this but I agree
"Thoughts on SSRIs. Hello, what are your thoughts/ experiences on SSRIs?","I tried various strengths of Zoloft. It did help a little, but only with certain symptoms for me. I'm also still in the process of getting a correct/official diagnosis though."
"I have no friends, Not sure where to go. So hi. I fucking hate this life.",I get this. Having no friends is a weird void. mostly lack of distractions I suppose. And filling that void is really hard. Doesnt help feeling existentially lost.
"Not good enough to be depressed?. Does anyone else ever feel guilty because their problems aren't as big as other people's problems so they shouldn't be depressed? I feel this heaps and it just makes me feel worse, feel like I'm stuck in between.","As someone said here previously, depression doesn't care who you are, where you are from, what you have or don't have. Even if you don't have serious problems, depression makes you feel like you're carrying all the problems of the world. It's true btw, there are people who are disabled, blind, deaf and still be happy, I don't have any of these problems, yet feel shit most of the time, and that makes me feel *guilty*.."
How do you guys keep going when it feels like you're 6 feet below rock bottom.. Edit: no thanks for the help guys,"Sorry this is over a month old but I do hope you are feeling better. The thing about bottom is, there is only one other place to go. Talking things out with someone often puts things into perspective but even the act of just getting things off your chest usually helps. Let me know if you want to chat, I will listen."
I don't even know anymore.. Feels like I'm faking all this bullshit for attention from people. Even writing this makes me feel like shit. I just have to let it out.,"Just let it out then, that's what this is place is for. Hugs, hope things become better for you soon! :)"
Hit 20 today and at my all time low. Hopefully I don't go any lower,Once you are at the bottom you can only go up. Hope things get better for you :)
Help. I'm going to kill myself tomorrow,What is going on? How long have you been thinking about this? Maybe we should talk about it first and think through some stuff...
Fuck this stupid fucking life. Why does everything turn to shit? Why does it *always* get worse and worse and worse.,I wish I could f*** it instead of the other way around for

I'm sorry, just don't have anyone else to say this to.","I find that how you view failure is tied to your expectations quite heavily. Or also the pressure of feeling others' expectations of you on your shoulders. I still haven't worked things out that I'm able to effectively handle failure myself, but mainly people can feel better when they fail, because they recognise it as a learning experience, or it is an inevitable part of the process. Now this may sound obvious, but when in the moment, it is very easy to forget this and lose sight of progress after the failure. Failure can appear in many forms. My expectation of a 'good outcome', instead was a horrible mistake... Or was it? I'm sorry to hear you feeling even worse after your suicide attempt. Just know that I believe you are alive, and fighting, and you will come out of this stronger."
Hey. I'm trying to find people to add on either PS4 or Xbox one I know this is a deppresion group and this is related to how my deppresion affects me I'd like to find decent friends on there for those who have it I'm happy to explain if Need be,"Sorry man, PC masterrace here. Hope you'll spruce up your friend list nicely."
Re-homed one of my dogs today. All I want to do is bring him home.,Why? Thats evil and selfish.
"do you channel your depression into mediums of expression?. for me, i draw. i draw mostly cartoony, happy stuff, which i guess is kind of weird since im not happy at all, but thats what i do how do you express yourself?",I'm jealous of you artists.. I play guitar and I've gotten to the point where I can usually play how I feel but it makes me feel worse normally...the same sad chords and melodies. Do you have any art you'd like to share? I'd love to see some
Did someone recover fully of depression ?. Wtf is this shit ! too many people are affected,"You never get over depression it is a daily struggle, but it brings to mind a Bojack Horseman quote: it get a easier but you have to do it everyday. That's the hard part. I've dealt with suicidal ideation for 2 decades, you never really get rid of those thoughts. We are essentially biological computers subject to our programming. We can't delete the program we've learned of suicidal ideation, but we can learn how to combat it, but it is a battle we must be ready to confront everyday. You are blind to your weaknesses but you are equally blind to your strengths. You aren't alone. Don't take your life. You aren't an isolated dust mote among 7 billion other dust notes. You are a node in a network, and the things you do and you don't do are far more important than you think. I wish you the best, and hope you see the power you truly have."
does anyone else feel like they are faking their depression even though you know its real?. And when you're happy you feel guilty.. like you're cheating.,"I do. *Kind of.* Let's not mix clynical depression and negative emotions together, they are totally different things. I realize that I'm stuck with the first type. I'm seeing the therapist, taking the medication and blah-blah-blah. Moreover, I can't say that I'm often in the teary mood. It usually feels like I'm tired of e v e r y t h i n g. However, sometimes it's bigger than me. Sometimes I want, no, there's a **NEED** for me to feel miserable. I want people to turn back on me, so I could only feel worse. That's why sometimes I fake the feelings and try to provoke others. I'm lost, *ha haha ha*"
I just really really want to die. I see no point anymore all people do is bother me,in what way do people bother you. Like they personally go out of their way or you mean like everyone including random people annoy you?
My family makes my depression so much worse and I'll never be able to move out. I have tried and tried to treat this depression and nothing works. What else is there for me other than suicide?. Why can't someone just give me an honest answer.,"You say you'll never be able to move out . . . sure you will! would you be moving to a new city or some where farther away? obviously, to move out, you will need a good paying job and money for an apt (by your self or with roommates.) tell your family that you are moving out on X date, if you are over 18, they can't really do anything about it. tell the police that you are moving away and your family is triggering your depression. they might try to file a missing person report if they notice that you go missing out of no where. suicide, I don't think, is ever the answer."
Went to the counciling center for the first time today and.... It was worth it. Today was my first experience with counciling and it made me feel much better. Anyone here who has the means to do so and has not please do this. It's worth the effort.,"I'm glad it worked for you. I've been going for a few weeks and so far it hasnt helped, so good that it helps some people"
I think I'm done now. I've stopped caring. I can't tell my parents to help me. I can't get help for my social anxiety and depression. It's all hopeless. I'm done. All I have to do now is get enough courage to take my life and then cease to exist.,Why can't you ask your parents for help?
I cry myself to sleep every night.. I just want it to end. It's too much,"Don't worry friend, rant all you want if it helps. I'm here for you."
I just want to not want to kill myself for one day. Is that too much to ask?,"Like when are waiting in line and waiting, waiting.....when is my turn."
"I actually felt happy. This may seem dumb but I actually felt happy today. I got high from weed, and it makes me happy. I'm always told that its bad but it made me happy for once","Yess I feel you, and I guess being depressed is bad for you as well so you're just trading one bad thing for another, except this one makes you happy. So yeah basically why I do it"
There are many beautiful things in life worth living for. Sucks that I'm too depressed to enjoy them though.,"This is so true but sometimes when in the funk of depression, it just feels like those beautiful things/moments in life are so far fetched. Feels like the pain go away"
I miss the warmth of affection. feeling lonely all the time. Wish that I could get a big bearhug and cry on someone's shoulder,"It's true we live in a society where crying in public or hugging strangers are frowned upon. We've gone very far into the illusions of separation and it's going to take some time to break through these, but it's going to happen I have no doubt anymore! I'm sending you love and hugs through the wire even if it's only designed for 0 and 1, feel it!"
Everyone hates me. My head hurts with all this depression. I have no friends no one to reach out to. I hate my life.,I don't hate you.  Wait. Are you responsible for the stairs that just aren't quite right? That's on my list of things that I hate.
"FML stuck with degree I hate. God damn it, I am stuck with a POS computer science degree and I hate working in tech industry. Wish there is reset button in life where I can press and return back to the past and change my destiny.","I have a Computer Science degree and can't find work x.x. Tbh, you can go back and get a new degree it's not to late :). What would you like to do?"
i feel so alone. no one would care if i died,"I joined here about 5 days ago, because I feel so close to the people here. like my family in a way. I know that sounds weird, but my point. I have depression, and feel alone as well. I feel like what I say matter, and no one listens to me. I do my best in something, and all I get in return is absolute shit! It pisses me off. I feel different as well, like not in the same league as everyone else. a quiet person, and am pretty shy around girls because not sure what they think of me. I think what you need is some independence :) It will make you happy, because that way not around people. I know it seems ironic because then be even more alone, but just pay attention to anyone. Be your own boss, and think of everyone else as just empty space. Think as is it matter what they say. Be a shield. let anyone get in your way. here on Earth, be here for a reason. The reason you feel lonely is because of people. Think about it."
if you keep on pushing people away and keep on doing this and that you will end up being alone. and i am alone now. i have lost everyone...,Feeling like you're a failure because you're depressed and you push people away -&gt; being depressed and pushing people away -&gt; repeat
DAE feel like their life is a short story rather than a novel?. I feel like I'm lucky to have made it this far.,I wish I was a short story. Life feels like its so drawn out. I want someone to just hurry up and get to the end
I feel like I’m a shining example of “fake it till you make it”.... Thats just never going to,"Well done, you've shattered the illusion :) But where are you trying to make it? Where are you going? Sometimes we all have to fake the way we are in order to get where we need to be, or get to what we want. But other times, all that effort is so dragged on and futile because we are working to satisfy some expectation. Then at the end of the day, satisfying the expectation is underwhelming--dissatisfying to its core. Then we just think, ok, now what? Just this post is poetic enough to make me think that you've got some fancy talents locked up in that head of yours. I wish you luck my friend, I bet you can make something of yourself, even if you struggle to believe it. And chances are, you've probably already done some neat things, and I hope you've taken the time to appreciate these accomplishments. I'm wishing you fantastic luck."
someone love me. how is this real life i hate everything,it's real life and it sucks sometimes but our mission is to collect all the good moments and make a sweet little stash to be proud of.
I feel so lost. I honestly don't know what I'm doing anymore. I feel like I'm losing who I really am and chasing fake highs to substitute for this dead inside feeling. I don't know who I am.,Sorry to hear. I hope you find something grounding that will help you feel alive again.
I'm sad because:. I can't connect.  I have no friends.  I have no lover.  I have no motivation.  Life is uneventful.  People are not good to each other.  I don't care enough to try.   I'm afraid of trying.  Afraid that this is all there will ever be for me.,"I can agree with every single thing you have listed there, and experience them all. It is not normal for a 24 year old good looking, well educated man to be feeling this way - but I have never felt right in life. The biggest thing that kills me is that I have never experienced a relationship or genuine friendship in my life. I find myself completely and utterly alone every day. My only communication is with my clients by email. I do leave the house, but it's only to go to the grocery store or for a walk - by myself of course. I read on the internet about all these wonderful holiday destinations that i'd love to visit, but I can barely afford it and going by myself is not enticing at all. Just sick of it.."
FUUUUUUUCCCKKKKKKK. Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuuuuuuckkk!!!!!!!!,I see your fucks and raise you one!
Everyday I ask myself why I haven't killed myself.. And as each day passes I have less reasons.,"I wish I had killed myself months ago, but I keep pushing it off one more day. Hopefully one day I'll just have a random heart attack or stroke. Maybe one day things will improve for both of us though."
I dont have anymore friends.... They all disappeared or turned on me... I'm so lonely,"I too don't have any friends, u aren't alone"
All I think about is mutilating myself. Destroy my body into nothing but a tangled mess of skin that doesn't exist anymore,"Not worth it. Consider yourself lucky to have a body and a mind of the most intelligent species known to man. It's hard to appreciate it when you're going through the motions, but as a squirming puddle of entrails, I think you might have some regrets about throwing it away."
Binging from depression. Does anybody else experience overeating due to their depression? It's like an endless cycle of depressed&gt;eat a lot&gt;depressed from loss of control&gt;eat more&gt;etc. It would be nice to hear some of your stories to know that I'm not the only one.,Yes I do. And the weight gain just makes me sink into further depression.
Just getting drunk enough to attempt suicide again. Obviously I have no one. Why should I even elaborate?,"Just stop brother. Just stop. You have a purpose, find it."
"I'm starting to need less weed to get through the day.. It's small progress, but I'll take it.",this is really really good. shows you're slowly dealing with your feelings or at least learning to tolerate them.
"I feel really alone. Man I feel awful , I broke up friendship with my best friend and I now have absolutely no female companionship whatsoever. I feel really lonely man. I share strained friendships everywhere.",People hate you because you're strong. The depression will turn to hate and you will want to slaughter faggots legally.
Best way to end your life?. What's the best and least painful way to end your life? I'm thinking about finally doing it and getting relief.,You won't find the answer you're looking for here. Use google.
"My inability to wake up for class might make me drop out, and I'm scared and don't know what to do. Help. I can wake up for work and for other things. I get over 8 hours of sleep, but I just can't manage to wake up for class. Any help would be amazing.",Is it an alarm problem or a I don't want to go so I just go back to sleep because fuck it what's the point in going problem? Most campuses offer free counseling so if you're concerned that this is a personal issue I would check that out.
Anyone depressed cause of loneliness?. I just want someone to love.,"Getting rid of depression gets rid of loneliness. I got depressed when I had a loving wife, good job, and many friends. After a decade of that I had no wife and few friends. I got medical help and five days after leaving treatment I have 5 new friends, am on speaking terms with a bunch of my neighbours I've never spoken to before and have hope. I have become outgoing and gregarious. Never would have believed that one. _effed_up"
Feeling really bad. All I want in life is to be loved and I'm never good enough I'm never worth anything to anymore,"I'm sorry. I've been in and out of a relationship for years now. She's loving and considerate and great in so many ways.. but there's no commitment. Actually the space between us has grown over the years. I guess part of it is that I'm a bit of a basket case and it can be emotionally taxing. I don't even want to put her through all of that for the rest of her life. But at the end of the day I just want to go home and share my life with her.. and she's not there. She's done so much for me but it makes me feel so unwanted that this is the end of the line. Like I'm just a burden and despite all the love she has to offer, I'm just too screwed up for it to work. I feel so lonely and so stupid for everything I've done to turn her away."
"I love/hate how my depression always lifts when drunk. It's so frustrating. I can see so clearly when drunk, I actually feel like working on my problems, I'm just so happy overall. Then I sober up and it's the same suicidal bullshit again. I don't understand why basic functioning is something I have to fucking work for...",Sounds like a rough ride. Would you like to quit drinking?
"my friends aren't friends.. I feel like there are so many people in my life who always say they'll be there, but they never are. why am I always on my own???","Everyone wants to be friendly, but few people want to put in the effort to be there for someone when it becomes inconvenient."
Depression and not being able to feel emotions? Or not being able to cry!. I have been trying to cry hoping that letting my emotions out would make me feel better. just impossible though. It feels like depression is dragging me deeper and deeper to the point where I feel happy or sad. Has anyone felt this way?,I'm no expert but perhaps look into anhedonia. Symptom meaning emotional deadness.
I'm Not Ok. Just wanted to tell someone.,"Why did you refuse meds? It definitely doesn't sound like you're very stable right now, and I can relate to feeling like you can't think straight and need to find something drastic to snap out of it. Meds help contain my worst moods though even if they don't rid me completely."
"Should I end my relationship over my own depression?. Should I do it... or not? :&lt; It's affecting my relationship, my bf knows I've had it in the past. But it's getting so bad recently that I think I should end the relationship before it gets worse.","Honestly I think you should just discuss this with him, even if it's in an indirect way like through text or email. Get your feelings out. If he's supportive, great, see if you can work things out. If he's not, take care of your own needs first."
I'm ugly. Stop trying to make me take pictures.. I can't even look at myself in the mirror,Well now people want photographic evidence :[ You probably look fine though
My dad is dying. So ontop of my depression i found out my dad is dying because the lupus he has has been killing him for the past 3 years. I dont know how to cope and want to kill my self. Im only 16 and honestly have tried to commit suicide before.,So sorry you are going through this. My mom died when I was 21. It's a traumatizing experience. I hope you have a supportive family. My family was only my mom and sisters at that time. Don't kill your self; your dad would not want that. Get help even if you don't feel like living right now. It does get better.
"I want to run away. I want nobody to know who I am and that I exist. Throw my phone away, buy a house in the forest, and sleep until I die. I hate being me, and I hate that people know me and judge me.",That would honestly be the best thing ever
"Im done with everything.. Nothing interests me anymore, life just keeps getting worse and worse, Im just done with it, I just hope I dont fail my suicide, good bye friends.",All I can provide for you is the cliche reply telling you that there is much more to life than struggling and that it can change if you try to. But non of this might affect you. You yourself have control of your own life and what you do with it. All I can say is that you might be making a really regrettable decision as you only have one life to live and enjoy to a degree. You only get one chance to feel anything if nothing and that is more than an incentive for most to keep going.
i did something horrible. when i was 18-21 i misled a older woman with marriage and kids for 3 years. i knew it was wrong since i have mentall issues. she is 30 now and desperate for kids/marriage i feel it is my fault that she have those and it makes me depressed,"Yeah pretty fucking horrible but not unforgivable. But your mental illness is no excuse. We are obligated to do our best every day to be good people, just like everyone else. THAT BEING SAID, what would you tell someone else who posted this? Hopefully that not the only person to make this mistake, and making mistakes make you a bad guy. The fact that you feel remorse shows that you have empathy and care about others."
Anyone else feel physical pain or discomfort while depressed?. Like in your chest and stomach area?,"Yeah, mostly in the chest area. It can be really painful if extremely depressed."
I’ve been fighting tears all day today.. been at work since 7am and been fighting back tears all damn day. just so damn lonely. I have friends and a gf but for some reason just not happy and I feel like I have nobody.,"I feel the same and i think its because i have nobody to talk to, nobody to be vulnerable to and let them know how i feel inside. Why dont you try to talk to your girlfriend, i bet if she'd new she'd try to help. Open up to her! Hope it goes well :)"
Every good memory I have is obscured by a haze of disgust.. Self loathing pollutes everyone and everything.,"I wonder what the solution is. In my life, I too am encouraged to allow myself to seek support online in a positive way (such as this forum) but this, too, only seems to make it worse and spread negativity."
i feel great. i told my first irl friend that depressed,what was his reaction? So brave of you btw? I told a few of my closest friends and we actually got even more close
Alone girl. I just want to find a connection,"2 nights ago i scratched all my face up when i had a panic attack, i shit my pants when i looked in the mirror, but now i look cool as fuck for halloween."
"I wish I could feel normal agian. I still remember my life before hitting depression couple of years back. I used to be creative, the fun guy who people liked to be around with, motivated and a lot more. Now I struggle to do even the simplest thing","I feel you my friend.. Things used to be so simple, right? My memories of happiness and the person I used to be are what keeps me going when I feel things are so heavy. Like, I know I have been happy and therefore I know it's a possible state to be in and surely I can attain that state again, somehow. But things used to be so simple. They are not anymore. If you haven't already I urge you to seek out a psychologist or therapist. The hard part is taking contact and telling them what's up, the rest is the easy part - even if it takes time."
I want it to end.. I don't know how much further I can go. I'm extremely depressed. I've got a gun and bullets. I just can't anymore,"There isn't a lot I can say or do that will really help you at this point in time. If you are feeling this low in your life that you want to die nothing I nor anyone else can say to change your mind but I will try my best to do what I can. There are people around you who can help you. Hospitals, doctors, therapist and counsellors. Over 20% of the worlds population deal with mental illness and seeing another person give in would be heartbreaking. Sadness is a passing feeling but depression is long term however it is recoverable. Things might be horrible right now but I promise you if you reach out and get help you can do this. You can get pass this difficult stage and these feelings will eventually leave. But perhaps you've already tried to get help and it hasn't worked. If so, thats ok. Therapy doesn't work for everyone but we can find a way to help you get out of this state so please before picking up that gun think of everything you will be leaving behind. Right now it may feel like you're alone and no one cares, but you won't know what truly will happen if you're dead. You won't be able to see people you love anymore, hear sounds of music or voices, see colours and people around you. A life you could have lived. You will be in an internal slumber, this is not a temporary way of dealing with this so please think this over. You can message me. I might not know how you are feeling right now but I will definitely be a person to listen and try to understand. I believe in you."
Is there a difference between compassion and pity? Can I get better at recognizing it?. I hate opening up to people because I am afraid they'll throw a pity party for me. I don't want to be pitied; I want to be understood. But it seems like everyone's first response is pity. It makes me feel like a burden to them.,At least it's something. Would you rather have them pity you or not give a shit? I feel alone with everyone I'm around. I think it'd be worse knowing I'm truly alone. Embrace it because they love you regardless how you are as a person. (How's that for not wanting to be pitied? ;) )
"Not arsed with school. Can't study or do homework.. My family is in a bad way right now and I'm in a bad way, mentally. I just can't care about school anymore. Feels hopeless",That's why I'm repeating 11th grade. It sucks.
My dog died a few hours ago.. Why does everything keep falling apart.,I know how it feels man. It sucks. terrible to hear and sorry :(
"When does it get better?. I've been on an ssri for three months, running 5km nearly every day, and seeing a counsellor. I feel like I am getting worse. I'm losing all motivation to continue putting in any effort what so ever to be better","I'm in a really depressed mood right now, which caused me to say it doesn't. But if you're losing motivation right now, there are many many ways to feel better that I'm guessing you haven't tried. And I think these things are individual, so it's hard to find the certain things, but I know you can do it. And maybe try a different counsellor if they aren't the best fit. How's your diet? How are you doing socially? So never lose hope."
"I just feel pretty shitty about myself right now. I dont know, life is better than it was before but I just cant seem to actually be happy. No matter how many happy moments, great days, at my core I think I will just always be unhappy","i feel like that, like family get togethers were much more exciting and now its like dead, not depressing but not the same"
5 years ago. On this day 5 years ago my dad passed away. Still think about that hospital room. Today has not been a good day.,"I'm so sorry, grah88. I hope your grief doesn't overwhelm you. You can get through this and I'm rooting for you."
ahhhhhHHHHHHHH. im going into a psychotic state because of this pain!!!!,"What's happening, friend ? &lt;3"
My husband says I have no reason to be depressed and that it’s stupid of me to always be so down. He says he’s sick and tired of it.. Does that mean sick and tired of me too?,"The only thing unreasonable about this situation is him. Communications is key, but if he listen it would be good to find someone to talk to"
I always feel like I don't deserve nice things... I've met some new people and they've been really nice to me but I always feel weird and like I'm not deserving of that... I'm tired of feeling like this,"Try self affirmations. Tell yourself nice things about yourself, even if you believe them. I tried probably 20, but landed on brave. People like me. Im Maybe even write them down on a sticky note and put it on your mirror."
"Is there anything that you still enjoy; if so, do you enjoy it a lot or only a little?. I enjoy coffee, but it only makes me feel slightly more motivated. Haven't felt actual joy in decades.",music. I kind of just have it on in the background at this point. But when that new album drops I get excited.
Does anyone else feel extremely lonely despite having friends and a loving family?. and when drunk I try to get as much attention as possible to feel special :/,"Yes. My friends are...not reliable. They mean well but they unintentionally exclude me out of things. I can't help but feel unwanted/filler. My family loves me, but they always treat me like I'm baby. It's becoming more dehumanizing and irritating everyday."
Winter blues. I've often fallen to my lowest during winter. How do you kick the blues?,"I've noticed it helps me a lot to go outside during the day, so that I can feel the sun (if there's any) and so I can smell fresh air."
"I'm just always so god damn bored. There's nothing I want to do, I don't enjoy anything anymore, so I just occupy myself with meaningless bullshit to help the time pass. It makes life feel so pointless.",Are you my doppelganger? I feel the same way. Even is boring.
"Anyone else spend countless hours searching for the perfect chatgroup?. I drift in between communities when I'm lonely and somehow, the next one might be 'the one', where I get loads of friends... If anybody knows of one pls let me know","I'd like to be in a chat group to get to know people with different experiences of depression, but I don't know of any."
Exam results in a week. and feeling like complete shit knowing i fucked up my A-Levels badly. I just feel so bad because i let my parents down and that i won't be able to get into university. Also fucking embarrassing telling everyone you've failed them..guess its my fault in the end.,Are you getting your results on the 10th or 17th of August? And did you write AS or A2?
im fucked. im fucked.my whole life is fucked,"wanna talk? msg me if ya want. im not gonna tell you what to do or why your life is not fucked. but im someone to talk to and i have been where you are and might understand you, in some way."
Does living at home make anyone else’s depression 63939395 times worse. I just feel like a little kid and a loser,yeah :/ my parents make me anxious to the point where i wont get food and water because i'm afraid of running into them. glad to be moving out
"I get so hung up over the smallest things.. I've been trying to eat healthy lately, but then I ate two cookies, and I really wanted to fucking die for the rest of the day. I'm not even kidding.",Over dramatic much?? It's a fuxkin cookie eat that shit then get off ur ass and walk .. regret feelings solved
"someone, please help fast I don't know what to do I might end up doing something. i had my geometry box taken away by a friend because i was using it to cut myself and now i found a compass and a blade which i can use to cut myself and i dont know what to do","Bury them in the garden (in some sort of container/jar of course, want some poor thing to hurt themselves randomly because of dangerous things left lying around)"
Depression is like standing in a puddle of darkness slowly being pulled under.. No one's coming to save me.,"well i guess when you put it that way, nobody would be able to save you. puddles are pretty small, probably like your inner circle, so the more people you have around you, the more chances you have to meet people who care about you. depression may feel like being encapsulated, but nobody can help if you domt ask for it. idk im drunk"
"Does anyone else turn the TV on when you're alone, just to hear someone else's voice?. I'm trying to hide from the lonliness.","I don't really use the tv, but I do usually have a youtube video playing on the background when I'm by the computer. I could be browsing random websites or trying to do some crafting etc, but I need the distraction of the videos. Also if I'm watching a movie or tv show I often have to do something else at the same time - solitaire, browse a magazine, read an article. I know I can concentrate just on one thing at a time, but there's something about too much quiet bringing bad thoughts to the surface."
"Feelings too real. When you are going through a hard time/the feels, what do you do to unwind? Music? Memes? Masturbation?","Mostly video games, keeps my negative thoughts away pretty well. Music I try to avoid because when I'm in those kind of hard times I tend to listen to music that I can relate to so it kind of brings more of the feelings to the surface. Memes are funny I guess. Masturbation is short term. Yeah video games."
I am depressed because I am a hopeless romantic. Which should never exist... Life makes love looks so fucking hard. No one wants me. I don't feel reciprocated. I feel self-entitled at times. I just wanna be wanted.,I'm sure you will see your way through. Just don't do what I did. Don't rush I to a relationship and don't have your head in the clouds thinking that its going to be heaven on earth. Don't be blinded from your emotions and always pay attention to reality.
"11:08PM: Overthinking on a perfectly good day, triggering an unnecessary anxiety attack.. Everything is just fine. Today is fine. Too fine. Whats fine? I'm fine. Am I fine? I must not be fine... Everything is not fine.",Preaching to the choir man. I feel yeah. Try to enjoy everyday. I know it can be hard.
"How often do you shift to depression/anhedonia?. Have to deal with that shit every evening at best, every week at worst. And they can't even give me meds because they are afraid of locking me in one state!","Wait, does this mean you're seeing someone already? I can see the concern, but if you're already suffering then not doing anything at all for you isn't really better. You can always look for a second opinion. I'm getting help, but before I was (and while I was trying to find the right combo of things), I'd have both depression and anhedonia at the same time pretty frequently. Like, 4-5 days out of a week. It sucked hard. Right now my anxiety is the bigger problem most of the time, but anhedonia still strikes and lasts like maybe a day to almost a week. Sometimes I make myself go do something outside of the house to distract myself, even if it's not actually enjoyable. This combo sucks, and I hope you find a way to lessen or even break the pattern."
"I want to live my own life. The life I'm living now is for other people. I'm not cut out for this.. No one really believes in me anymore. These feelings of anxiety and depression will never leave. I'm fighting but it's hard knowing that when you reach out, you're only beaten harder.","&gt; These feelings of anxiety and depression will never leave. I feel the same way. It's hard too because when someone does believe in you, you can't even tell anymore. Maybe you think it's because they just want to be nice or maybe it's because of other reasons, idk. Just don't keep fighting. If the life you're living isn't making you happy, it's not what you want, why don't you change it? I'm not saying it's easy, or that you even can. I'm just asking I guess if you want to explain why you're stuck living for other people rather than yourself."
"For some reason, officially giving up and not caring anymore has made me feel sort of happy.. I genuinely feel like smiling. Imagine that.","Taking the pressure off, in and of itself, can be a big deal."
I just had the worst fucking day ever. Arghhhhhhh... god.. This was the worst fucking day ever..,"What happened today? If you feel like you need someone to listen to you, I can be here."
"If i live, i am a burden. If i die, i am a burden.. What the hell am i supposed to do",you can't win this game ! damnet.
"Feel as if I'm dead. The best opportunities seem to have come and gone without me realizing. Everything's felt too painful for me to enjoy anything anymore. At this point, I think I'm pretty much a dead man.",Something will come along soon. Serendipity happens.
I'm so tired. I don't think I can go on any longer,"Hey, I know I'm some random stranger on the internet but I hope you continue on &amp; keep fighting. I want to say things get better, I'm not sure if they do, but something's got to give right? I hope whatever's making you feel super down right now gets better &amp; you find happiness. I know easier said than done but if you ever need to talk myself &amp; plenty others are always here!"
"Is psychiatry a good idea?. Currently in a bad spot, not a great way to correct it normally without getting into a worse one. Normally, I'm against drugs for treating mental disorders but it seems like a quick way out right now if it helps. So basically, does it work for anyone?","Psychiatry and/or psychology can be a big help. Psychologists, at least in Illinois, can't prescribe, so their first choice may not be drug therapy."
"I’m holding on.. depressed as shit, but holding on. not giving up.",a sign of emotional strength and mental strength. Keep it up. on your team. :)
WHat the fuck is wrong with me?. WHy do I always do this to myself? Why do I let it keep happening? Ugh.,"Yeah, we're creatures of habit unfortunately. I also find myself falling into the same pits over and over again but yknow what? Sometimes life just clicks together and all the pieces fit into the big picture and you find that moment where you can change. It doesn't have to be overnight, but look for some baby steps that can put your forward. best of luck x"
I don’t know what to do.. in bed crying rn and I know why. I have any huge reason i just feel sad please help,"Is anyone home you can talk to? Has anything happened in your life recently? If feeling really sad/hopeless and it persists or has persisted for a while now, talk to someone about it. I hope you feel better soon, I know it sucks horribly going through that."
"Anyone else keep sighing?. I can't help it. Anytime I do something a little bothersome I just sigh and sigh,,,",Wow. I thought I was the only one. When depressed I sigh a LOT.
just failed suicide what do i do family is going to know. what the fuck do i do,Why did you want to commit suicide?
This year is my last change to figure out I'm not capable of being a real person before being forced into it anyway. Title says it all. Just feeling trapped again as usual. How's your day?,"I can feel myself spiraling into another deep depression but I can't do anything to stop it. I just realized today that as I sat in a room full of my friends I felt alone and unhappy. It also doesn't help to watch my mother drink obscene amounts of alcohol, destroying her mind, and not being able to do anything about it."
i need drugs more than anything. i need something to make me feel happy.,with you. For me it matter what it is.. just as long as it stops the thoughts.
"Just failed a suicide attempt. I feel as though I have nothing else to do at this point, I don't think I'm ever gonna get anywhere in life and I'm just terrified of the future","I feel you man. I attempted suicide 3 times last year because I see the future really getting better, no matter how hard I try. why I hate when people say gets better, not because a raging pessimist. I hope this makes you feel at least a little better"
"Has Abilify made anyone else more depressed?. I think it did to me, but It could just be something else.","Yes, several years ago I was on Abilify and.. Cymbalta I think? The whole call your doctor if you experience worsening thoughts of depression and suicide thing became a reality."
I feel invisible. I just wish someone would make eye contact with me once in a while. I'm a human being.,I know what you mean
"Whenever I open up about my depression, and people are there for me and try to help me, I get defensive and feel even less worth.. Please don't tell me I'm the only one...",You arent I dont get defensive but yes talking about it to people make me feel like im burdoning them and then i feel even more like shit because im pushing my problems on someone else. Whats going on with you?
Can't go on. I don't know how much more I can take these sleepless nights and feeling worthless,"What is your consciousness worth to you? That's what should matter most. What good can you do with your mind and what's getting in your way. Don't weigh the bad against the good and make a judgement, fight to keep the good alive for as long as you can. You life is once in a lifetime. You're lucky to be alive and to be human. For most people, things can usually get a lot worse. If your problems stem from your sense of worth, don't let someone else determine your value. How much is life worth? Probably worth more than anything in existence, it can't be bought."
Does anybody else look at their reflection and instantly get really upset?. Whenever I see my reflection in a camera or a mirror I feel myself fighting back the urge to just sit there and cry. It's like I'm not even looking at myself anymore.,"Its not upsetting...very surreal though. Sometimes I move my hand and watch the person in the mirror move theirs too. It doesn't feel real, I mean. I know its me but it doesn't feel like that."
"im so fucked. im totally fucked,my depression is so bad,i cant even open my eyes.",Hey buddy you are not alone. I spent a day where I literally didn't so much as sit up in bed a couple of weeks ago. Didn't eat or drink anything so I didn't need the bathroom which was good. I'm not at a point where I have any advice to give or anything but maybe you can find some comfort knowing that other people feel the same as you.
Does anyone else just walk about their house overthinking fucking everything for hours on end?. I hate life all the time it sucks !,yes. lofe is shit. i walk around my home hours on end just like you. nothing i do can save me from suffering. All cause i am ugly smelly balding indian midget.
What if this is as good as it gets?. What if life doesn't get better. It just gets easier...,Tbh it probably is. been trying to convince myself for years that it gets better but I know at this point
I consider every day I don’t kill myself to be a failure. And do not tell me to go exercise,"Why? You should consider every day you DON'T kill yourself a success. It's harder to keep on living. You know that. It takes an extreme amount of effort, and you should be commended for carrying through."
I dreamt that someone shot me in the head. I wish that dream would come true,"I dreamt that too. When I started to die, everything started slowly fading and falling away. The more dead I became, the more I woke up. It was like I was aware that I was in a deep dreamless sleep when I was dead. Then I was awake in shock. More surprising than scary. Life is like a dream now."
"Changing my perception. I read a lot of online forum and article that mental illness is forever,you will need meds forever.I have been diagnosed with schiz,I wonder when will I recover and don't need to obediently take the evil meds with a lot of side effect","I can tell you this much: If you can tell whether or not the medication is making a positive difference, then I'd say that it's worth enduring the negative side effects. As a side note, I feel like I've heard of/known people who eventually weened themselves off of their meds and ended up not needing them, but it's probably different from person to person. I have no idea what the future holds for you, and there's probably no definitive way to predict how things will end up for you and your medication, so good luck."
No point when there is nothing.. Life is so fucking painful when you don't have anyone or anything to hold on to. When a person literally has nothing what is there to even go on for? This loneliness is going to kill me. I have nothing.,"Hey. I understand what you are feeling, and I am so sorry you are experiencing this. :( really such a hopeless feeling. Please feel free to PM me if you would like to talk. About anything."
Lump in throat. Anyone else have this? Just constant feeling of difficulty breathing Looking for a way to get rid of this. Holding me back and I'm slowly becoming more and more filled with anxiety.,Are you on any medications? This can actually be a side effect of certain meds.
I want to give up.. So very badly. I've ruined everything good in my life. I can't take this pain anymore. I want it to stop. I want to be dead. This is too much. I can't undo my stupidity and now I'm fucked. I can't do this.,"I have been at a similar point to you where I had suicidal ideations on a daily basis and to be honest, even when aspects in my life have improved, I still struggle with it frequently. I have done many things in life I regret and feel like I've fucked up a lot of situations, relationships and opportunities in both my personal and professional life. It took me a long time to understand that I can't go back in time and fix anything. It is fucking terrifying to feel like you've messed your life up but please trust me when I say that it's ok to fuck up. You are human. We all are. I have found that being alone with my thoughts was a big factor in triggering urges to harm myself or get stuck in my thought loops about how useless or worthless I am. If you have someone you trust to talk to, please dont be afraid to rant or reach out to them. My inbox is always open too if you need a stranger to listen. You're not alone in this."
Helping people. Does anyone else try to help others feel better because you dont want them the feel the way you feel? Its one of the only things that kinda makes me feel better.,I want to give it all.
"Thought about how easy I️t would be for me to just slam my car into a barrier on the highway and end I️t.. be hard, just one quick turn.",Oo boy dont give me ideas now
I hope I die in my sleep. That way no one will feel guilty,I am trying my best to have a stroke! getting there because my face goes numb almost every day... and every time it does I get excited.
"I woke up early this morning. I didn’t get junk food. I went to the gym. I did great at work, and I met up with friends..... ...but why do I feel like a depressed piece of shit. beating myself up so much around people and friends. It make sense. I should be having a great time. I a lazy piece of shit today","Because sometimes it just takes time. Serotonin and dopamine take their time to adjust. Also, though the gym is great, it will deplete you so you might be suffering from that. Get a lot of protein, magnesium and zinc and repeat tomorrow. And congrats! You did great today."
"Should I tell my gf?. Recently got together with someone and thinking about telling her about my depression, not sure if it's a smart move that early into a relationship though. Anyone got advice?","I'm thinking it all depends on you and you're expectations towards the relationship. If you see this going somewhere and lasting she will no doubt eventually figure it out, night aswell be from you. Then again it's also about weather or not you feel comfortable with her knusing it at this stage. There is no time limit and I personally think it all boils down to your expectations and wishes."
"Got some help today. And by help I mean I went in there, she said oh you have suicidal thoughts? To which I answered yes, and basically it ended quickly after that with a Here's a prescription for prozac. Have a nice day","Yah professionals don't give a fuck. Pisses me off when someone says 'go see a therapist' -- no bitch I need some love because I'm broken from an abusive past, bullying, and that the fact is no one wants to do or associate anything with me if I reveal my true self... Are you gonna take the Prozac?"
"Has anyone taken Viibryd?. Please describe your experience with Viibryd, if you've taken it.",Took it for 2 years. It was the best medication I had found. Started wearing off after a couple years and I nolonger take it.
The pain it will bring to my parents is the only reason I am not dead. Funny thing is I thought I was free of depression but it's always there just waiting for a moment to suck you back in,"Yep. You are never 'free' of it. I thought this as well a while back because thing were really going well, but it reared its ugly head again. I am still really suffering through this bout. I am glad you feel your parents would suffer from your death. I wish I thought mine would. (My father is already passed, but I know that the 'suffering' my mother would feel is from the social stigma of having a suicide in the family. It would have nothing to do with losing me."
Psych Ward Day 5. I lose track of time in here,"I'm sorry. That's horrible... Are things getting better there, at least?"
Everyone's having fun with their summer while I'm here hating life. I used to enjoy summer... Not anymore,Move to Australia. winter there
"i don't think i can take much more. well, my hair is falling out, i feel like crap, i cannot be happy when i am this ugly, so.....i don't think i can live","I lost my hair as well some years ago because of stress and depression. Please try to feel better, eat enough and sleep. I swear, not having as much hair as others do makes me feel horrible. So try keeping on yours."
My alcoholic mother sat and told me how she wants to kill herself and said it'd be great if she never seen me again. I'm so tired of this bullshit.,I'm sorry you have to deal with that toxic kind of person. If I may ask I imagine you still live with her and have to deal with this kind of garbage pretty often?
Everyone at my NYE party is happy but me. Only three memorable things happened this/last year for me...,&gt; Giving a girl my number but never getting a text Exact same thing happened to me a few days ago. How were the bands live?

Dont Know What To Do Anymore.... Im fucking done.. Im sitting hear about to end this right now. I dont know what to do right now. I wrote out a note but its shit. Im done. No one cares about me. Any advice please... I really need it right now,"Happy to listen if you care to type, pm me any time, also I care about you."
In one of those moods I can't shake. Just feeling like I don't want to do this anymore. What techniques do you use to pull yourself out of bad funks?,"Strip club. Get some taitais in your life, even if you gotta pay for that shit. Don't be just jackin it in the bedroom man! If you go to a strip club you already winning cause you got up and went outside! Bitches got ears too, not just for fucking, if you talk to them they actually listen to shit you saying! Just remember to get the money up front."
I'm going to be alone my entire life.. Even I don't to be with myself..,I wish someone would kill me so when the news comes it has me as killed instead of suicide.
"Boyfriend (22M) confessed to me (22F) that he has trouble finding empathy for my depression.. over 5 months pregnant, facing the worst depression of my life. medicated (Wellbutrin) but been having a lot of down days lately, suicidal thoughts starting to come back. Idk what he even meant by what he said, but it still hurt for some reason. I really feel close to him emotionally and I try my best to cover my emotions around him and right, him telling me what he said would make feel more alienated from him. I feel so alone.","Have you guys been dating for awhile? I hate that you feel you have to cover your emotions because I feel I do all the time. I think its extremely hard for those without mental illness to understand what we go through. I used to find as many analogies or ways to explain it as I could online since I'm not very articulate myself. I hope things get better and that they do so soon. Above all, I hope that you and your baby are safe."
"What books have helped you? Anything I can buy off Amazon? Either something that has inspired you, changed your way of thinking, fucking anything at this point.. Need so fucking help. Hoping that reading something would help.",The no bullshit guide to depression. Hard core self help. Fu** depression.
Why are you depress?. I dont know myself im ok now because im highhh i think because i over look everything the point that nothing feels natural Like im not myself I need to get better.,I don't know either. I guess there are too many reasons that caused me to feel depressed. I don't know if I want to actually get better because if it feels as if I am lying to myself about how life is good.
I wish I didn't fucking break down in public two years ago.. Now I'll always be a bitch to society. I will never really be able to live a dignified life.,Why even care what random people think of you? likely go crazy worrying about that stuff
"I want my relationship to fail for reasons outside of my own doing (cheating, etc.) so that I can look back and say I had no choice to leave - because I don't want to live my life wondering if I made the wrong choice..

"I don't know how to continue anymore. I'm 24 years old now. Always had suicidal thoughts all my life. Due to being bullied in school. Due to not having friends in highschool. Failure after failure in college. I never gave up. And then I was diagnosed with herniated disc which caused me pain for the last two years. Sciatica in my right leg all the time and also in my left leg at times. And I'm going bald which is giving me a lot of confidence problems. And now like the cherry on top , I've been diagnosed with cervical disc problem. Just don't know what to do anymore. I'm 23, how the hell am I supposed to live the rest of my natural life in pain everyday. And the average life span in my family is almost 90 years. My family doesn't seem to understand how bad my pain is. My dad understood it when he saw me limping due to pain in my legs. But my mom and the rest of the family always trivializes it. They call me lazy when I try to take rest in bed . She won't understand no matter how many times I explain it.","I'm so sorry to hear about your situation--that's a really difficult thing to have to endure, especially with your family's lack of understanding. I don't think you should give up the possibility of finding relief for your pain--even if there is not a reliable treatment now, pain relief is a major area of medical science research. (Is medical marijuana legal where you live, or if not is it a possibility to move to where it is?) You might find support and recommendations at r/sciatica Hang in there. I would strongly recommend trying to talk to a therapist if that's an option. Otherwise, it seems to me the other most important thing you can do is to try to find work or an activity, paid or unpaid, that is meaningful to you (if movement is an issue, look up online opportunities) which will help you get your mind off of your pain."
I wish I had artistic talent. Art has been my obsession all of my life but i'm so bad at it because i'm an idiot. a cognitively deficient fuck up is what i am,"Nah man, What you're saying is actually quite common of someone who is good at art. Most people with a high degree or artistic talent are really good at *recognizing* good art, but get frustrated because their own art doesn't live up to the crazy high standard they've set for themselves. Malcom Gladwell suggests that it takes 10,000 hours to gain mastery in something. Art is a skill just like anything else. I think a lot of people get fooled into this You either have it or you don't mentality when it comes to creative arts. It's just not the case. I think it's more important that you actually have an obsession and something that you want to be good at! Most people don't have that. Just keep practicing and never give up. If you have the drive you will succeed eventually. You'll get better and better every day."
If I have ever amounted to anything it would probably be nothing. I am less than nothing.. i hate myself I'm gonna get drunk again.,"Are you saying that you are typically harmful to the world and so your best aspiration would be to become a net zero for the world instead? I'm sorry if you feel that's the case. If the drinking is correlated with the problem, you might consider looking up groups of people who try to quit drinking together."
I’m so fucking lonely. so fucking lonely and I shake the feeling. Alone in my apartment and just know what to do anymore.,"I feel you dude, I am 25 and I have never had a girlfriend, I don't know how it feels to get hugged, there were never a girl in my life, who said she likes me for who I am. No friends or family, who are trying to cheer me up. Just me, work and my depressed thoughts that are preventing me to fall asleep every night. I am so lonely, it feels like deep cuts into my heart. I want to end this fucking pain."
"I smoke because I want to commit suicide in an socially acceptable way. I smoke when I'm sad, anxious and when I want to die. It's comforting. I think: Well, I'm abbreviating my time on Earth and i deserve it and I like it.

"People who say it gets better don't really know what depression is. I just read yet another it gets better article trying to convince teenagers to not commit suicide. I never tell that lie. I never say it gets better. I say you need to learn how to fight through it. People that think that it gets better do not know what true depression is. They might have had a shitty thing happen to them where they thought for one moment that they didn't want to live any more, but they don't know what it means to live a life of feeling that way. They don't know what it is to lay awake at night, wandering why you can't sleep, and why you are drowning again, when you have been doing so well, only to realize you forgot to take your meds the past couple of days. They will never know what it feels like to accept that this is your life. You will forever be fighting it. You will pray for God to give you peace of mind, and the only way he can give it to you is through a pill that still fails you sometimes. It is tough knowing that some people will never understand.","People always tell me ''it could be worse''. It could be worse? No, it really couldn't be much worse. This is a disease of the brain - the part that makes out the very essence of our self, the part that tells us about the world around us, that allows us to draw conclusions about the world, have morality and feel everything from the love poets have written about since the advent of letters to the soul crushing despair ahead of the final override of our animal nature: suicide. If you can't rely on that, you are fucked. If you suddenly can't feel some emotions anymore, you're fucked. If you no longer feel the moral qualms that have guided you for years, you're fucked. Please tell me what is worse than only being able to use a computer to interact with your environment and that computer being broken in a way we don't understand? Just that it is worse than that, because there is no you. You are the computer and your network card is fried, your CPU has a tear and your battery no longer holds charge...and there's nothing that can be done. All you can do is grit your teeth and keep going. Try to adjust to the fact your version of reality is not actually real and that information you are getting about your body is downright not true - apart from when it is, because if your brain believes you have no energy, you sure as fuck have no energy. Try to not let the lack of love and happiness and the very concept of hope throw you into that pit of despair. Now, pray tell me, what precisely could be worse? I'd rather be hungry with a broken arm, because then I would still know that it is me who is hungry and that my arm hurts. I could still believe that may be tomorrow there will be food. I would feel the natural drive of self preservation to bandage that arm. You have no concept of what a malfunctioning brain means and I hope that you never will, but please do not compare it with other experiences, because there is nothing like it short of hypoxia at the summit of Mt. Everest - there you are starving the brain of oxygen and get an impression of it slowly shutting down. People pay a lot of money so they can have the experience and know they pushed through within the day it takes them to do the last stage. I am trapped there. Every day of my life. I can't descend. Ask someone who went up the mountain if there is anything worse. Just that I'm also walking into school/work each day. I do chores. I get dressed. I pay bills. While just wanting to lie down and give up so bad."
"Natural remedies for fighting depression/social anxiety?. So, yeah. The title pretty much sums it up. I would like to hear personal stories of success(and also failure).","Supplements: --- Fish oil: There is some evidence that fish oil with 2 EPA to 1 DHA ratio helps with depression. Helps me a bit but maybe placebo effect. 5-HTP: Tried while really depressed/anxious and it didn't help. SSRIs didn't either and only a long acting Benzo did anything beneficial. Might try again later. Valerian root: Calms some people down. Doesn't do much for me. Rhodiola Rosea: Apparently gives you more energy while keeping you calm. Maybe a bit more energy for me but could be placebo effect. St. John's Wart: Supposed to be a natural antidepressant. I am thinking of trying it soon. Magnesium: Helps some people (assuming deficiency exists) but I have not tried it yet. Alcohol: Works great to calm social anxiety in a moment! Don't consume if taking prescription drugs. Consume in moderation if you need to drive home. Marijuana: Can really elevate mood, depends on the person. Can be combined with alcohol for added effect. Don't drive at all after using it. Don't use if illegal where you live or your employer drug tests. --- Lifestyle: --- Exercise: Some people rave that being active reduces anxiety and depression. In my case the gym is actually a trigger. I do enjoy going for a walk on a nice day though. Diet: I have started eating better and less. I have lost substantial weight and feel physically better. The sense of accomplishment and feeling better about my body has probably helped my depression. Travel: If you can afford it take a vacation and go see the world. Go alone so that you can discover your true self and not be at the whim of another person. It was an extremely positive experience for me. ---"
If there is no utopia then why even live?. If a perfect society that can't even exist then why even live? Life is pointless.,People attempt to create Utopia for themselves and those around them that they like - as they have since time immemorial.

"i did a bad. I was behaving shittily to my friends, requiring an intervention from one of them, and even though everything seems to be alright for now, I can't forgive myself or overcome my guilt. It hurts. I can't even speak to them.","What was the end result of the conversation you had with them? Was everyone impacted there? Was there an explicit apology and acceptance of that apology? When you say that you think things are cool now, what are you basing that off of? Some guilt never goes away, even if the impact of the action does."
I'm done saying I love you to her because I don't want to hear a lie back to me. I feel so ugly and unwanted and unloved,"Do you have any friends that aren't always going to blow sunshine up your ass or a therapist? That you can talk to about how you feel that she treats you and get like... An unbiased opinion? You've mentioned elsewhere here that you may have been over reacting. I know that I struggle with recognizing when I'm justifiably upset vs letting my depression's self hate mode move on to the other things I care about. Being depressed should be proof enough in itself that feelings can't always be trusted, or listened to, or followed, even if they're obviously there."
"I broke down and made a Facebook status recently in an effort to say I'd be going on a hiatus to clear my mind and get off drugs, I must have got 40 messages of support..

i dont feel worthy enough to live!?. i literally dont see anything special in me and im a dissapointment. how can i stop feeling this way?,"I often feel the same, but many people don't find their life's purpose until later on in life. Either way the only person whose opinion matters is you, so don't let anyone tell you different. Everyone is unique and doesn't live the same life or the same way! As for how to stop feeling that way, it really depends. Maybe talking about the reasons you feel that way would help? Perhaps trying to try new things and find that thing that makes you feel important, proud, happy, successful, etc. could help. Regardless I hope you are able to see the part of you that is already there that is special OP. Message me if you ever wanna talk more about it, I struggle with it often as well."
"I'm 22, I've literally spent 1/2 my life wishing I were dead.. I started wishing i would never wake up again when I was about 10. Ive had thoughts about death or suicide practically every day since then. Im coming to the realisation that I have to literally BE a different person to feel better. I have always been like this, i dont know anything different, i cant even imagine what it feels like to not feel like this. Im not a shitty person because of my depression, ive just always been a shitty person. And i can never change, so whats the point.","I've had a similar realization recently, but my reaction is a bit different. I've decided to try my past to fight against these thoughts and problems to find ways to be happy sometimes. I have bad social anxiety and have started trying medication and meditation. Honestly it often feels harder than just giving into the depression. Forcing myself to go places that could make me feel uncomfortable because of too many people. Taking classes where I learn something completely new. But maybe in the end I'll be glad I've done these things."
Time. What has been the most effective use of time in overcoming depression?,"Trying to study, understand, and accept yourself -- relatable music, expressive activities, which invoke you out from within, out of your own being, and into any form of materialized form to see/hear clearly. Et cetera. Basically spending time with your own self on deeper levels, as difficult and sometimes even saddening that may be and feel so."
Emotional or emotionless. 3:34 am I feel the pain all too well and have for some time and I'm unable to let the feelings out. I am unable to cry,"The thing that drives emotion the most for me is what I want. When I have no clue what I want to achieve or maintain, I can't show any emotion because I have no clue how it affects me. Finding those goals is one the hardest battles but the most rewarding and eye-opening."
Any other mid 20 year olds who haven't gotten a job yet?. Just asking. Domt want to feel like I'm the only dumbass. Which is most likely.... 9 to 5 with overtime sounds good. And its rewarding overall. Everyone needs to survive and theres many fucken ways to make money now. I'm just stuck and afraid personally.,Make a resume and send it out
"I feel like no matter what, nothing is worth it.. not worth it to get out of bed, not worth it to go to college, not worth it to live because no matter what there is always going to be stress and depression and misery. Not matter how hard I work it change. not worth the struggle to live, happiness worth it. I stand it anymore.","Nothing will change until you change. still struggling every minute and every second with this too, so right there with you. Everything is shit, until you see it differently. Just imagine the YOU whose conquered this hell in your mind, what do you think he would tell you?"
DAE have this? Any happy moment is ruined by this thought: This would be a good moment to be my last.. Every happy experience is accompanied by this. Makes it impossible to enjoy things or get past my issues.,I have tried to kill myself **while happy** for that exact reason.
Kill me.. I have nothing else to live for.,I feel ya.. Hope that you'll get through this moment in time.
"Depression lies. Does it though? It feels like it's the other way around, help is a lie, optimism is bullshit, and depression is just the natural consequence of witnessing a shitty, broken life finally collapsing on itself. Maybe I'm just in too deep right now.","I think that's the fucked up thing, it lies so much we think the happy stuff is also lies. I mean I also feel like being happy is bullshit and nearly impossible, but hey who knows maybe that's the depression talking again"
I have a strong urge to cut myself. Everyday I fantasize myself cutting and I have to grab hold of my arms so I wouldn't do it.,"What I did was have a rubber band at all times so when the urge came, I'd pull my rubber band and let it sting my wrist. Maybe you can try that? I also go running. I cry while I run but I feel good after..."
"Me: Finally travels abroad. Also me: not enough energy to leave the bed for most of the day.. I get to be depressed in international beds, guys!",Force yourself to take a shower in the morning. Then force yourself to get dressed and take a walk. No end goal in mind. Just a nice leisurely walk. what I did abroad and I found myself in the most fantastic places.
What to do when feeling suicidal. Feeling really anxious and suicidal know what to do,i would recommend you check out r/suicidewatch
"Do you ever just walk with no purpose?. I've been doing so constantly, I ignore whatever's going on in my life for an hour or so and just walk. I walk and hope that when I get back everything will be better. But when I get home nothings changed, it's still filled with sadness. I don't know...","You may feel shitty when you get back, but FWIW, the walk is still good for you. It's a little exercise, maybe a little sun (depending on the weather and where you live), and it's something that feels good for you in the moment. May not be much, but I've always found it's important to recognize the little tiny positives like these. So good for you, take those walks when you can and remember it's a small way to take care of yourself and your mental health. Bike rides are awesome too."
"i dont even know what i feel. or why i feel it, all i know is it feels like a pit in my chest and makes me want to die. how the fuck do you fix an unidentifiable feeling.","I don't have any feeling inside my chest, ever as far as I can remember. I mean literally, I'm not making some silly metaphor. I'm trying to figure out whether that might be a medical problem, or maybe it's normal and people just talk in metaphors all the time."
Today is my birthday. its almost 8 hrs and no one wished me yet,HAPPY BIRTHDAY!! You should get a cake for yourself and eat all of it!
I really thought I wasn't going to drink tonight. And I'm just about done the bottle.,"ive never drunk before, whats it like?"
I’m ready to die. so sick of hurting I just want it to stop,"I know that feels, it probably will disappear one day. Just give it some time."
"new years day, feeling a lil hopeful, immediately get scammed.. :) was a mistake not to kill myself last christmas.",&gt; [...] immediately get scammed. How so?
"1 month since being dumped.. My way of coping is Beer, Smokes &amp; sad music. I miss you, But I hate the way made me feel. I hate what done","I am sorry...time helps more or less, it's hard to forget someone like that, 4 months later, I am not sure if I feel any different unfortunately.."
I like my drunk self better. I'mn so much more spontaneous and willing to sacrifice perfection to just have fun when I'm drunk. Is anyone else like that?,"I am. It's hard to be sober, because I don't feel like the fun joyful person I am when I'm drunk. When I'm not drunk I'm depressed and anxious and in pain and I hate it. And I'm sorry that you're feeling like this :( I'm here for ya"
All day every day I look forward to nighttime so I can fall asleep. I am only happy in my dreams. I hate being awake.,"Same dude, the only thing I look forward to now but I hate waking up every morning"
Does any find hobbies to actually work?. I want to be able to pour my energy into something but I don't know is someone with a depressive disorder can commit to finishing or committing to a hobby. Does anyone have hobbies or projects that keep them motivated day to day?,"I cant finish anything. Want to learn piano, too much work to structure or figure out how. Want to write/read/be creative, brain is too dead."
Someone please help me. Please. Help. Me. I'm Begging. You. To. Help. Me.,What can we do to help?
Hello!. How are you all? :),"Tired......I'm going to eat and then go to bed. Fuck my homework. I'll maybe do it tomorrow morning, probably not."
"I need a hug. Is that too much to ask? Is it too hard a task? No, it's not It's just that I've never told anyone about my distraught I wish I had the courage to make it known to ask for help, because I can't go on alone",I understand how you feel. Being able to talk to someone without worrying about being judge. Knowing that person that you can feel comfortable with is something that many of us have a hard time finding.
Does anyone else get a kind of restless anxiety? How do you deal with it?. One aspect of my depression seems to be an inability to sit down and focus on anything. I have a constant level of anxiety and A short attention span. My interest in things dies very quickly. Has anyone dealt with this and found a way around it?,"When I watch films.Unable to concentrate on anything else,almost unable to take rest."
I’m 16 and trans. to the point if susicide help me,"Find a new one. I've had several therapists, and too many of them were just a really bad fit. Especially the last one, she was super nice but way, way not helpful to me. I'd blame myself too if sessions weren't good. There's some classic depression for ya. But I guess it's common knowledge to try different therapists until you get a good fit? I didn't know that for years so now I kinda overcompensate by telling everyone to shop around as needed. Good luck."
"Hello im new. Hi I'm AJ, I'm a 16/M with depression and disabilitys, and gay. I've had depression since I was around 7 due to bullying. I'm extremely weird and dislikable but it never hurts to make a friend online",Hi AJ! glad to meet ya! Welcome to the sub jen. 31 and been depressed off and on since I remember when. Crappy family life yadda yadda. What kinda stuff are you into?
You guys make me feel like I belong. I don't belong anywhere else.,I love you all. Genuinely the replies here made me feel much less alone. your kindness is beautiful
The only problem left when you find the cure.... You don't have the energy to employ it.,"The cure is less stress and ways to de-stress. Then your brain will start operating better. Why? Because you don't have energy, focus, clear thoughts, motivation and thousand other things precisely because of too much stress that got out of hand and you can't handle it anymore. I'll give you one example. Do you know what happens when there is too much cortisol? Look up high cortisol symptoms. So to unravel these symptoms is to only go in reverse, by finding ways to constructively de-stress."
Everyday i wish i was dead. There's nothing good about life anyways. I'm better off dead.,"Ditto. Been hyper depressed this past week. Having an absolute fuck of a time getting myself to do simple things. Like eat. Or get up. Life looks pretty bleak and it's all my fault. Doubt it gets better either, cause I'm the only one who can make it better and I suck. Hopefully tomorrow is a little better. FWIW you aren't alone."
Hobbies. I need to come up with some hobbies that can substitute drinking and drugs for me. Everytime I start something it seem fulfilling and a waste. I also hate doing things alone but I have developed serious social anxiety over the years. I know!!,"Do you like art? Reading? Movies? Things like that. With the job and time restraint, have you thought about possibly making a schedule for yourself so you can find time to do group activities? Edit: Also, with the drinking and drugs, do you have time for that or is that during work hours?"
nothing. at this point it feels I don't have emotions. im just numb. and tired.,"I get it. I had the worst Christmas to date..,.and I just was kind of just on autopilot. Things that normally evoke at least some sadness or happiness or anger or anxiety, even bother me. I felt nothing. like disappearing. No one checks on me. No calls from family, no texts from been days. Everything just seems gray. even the point anymore?"
Thanks Parents. Woke up feeling really shitty and depressed today. My parents then had a go at me for not wanting to do anything and saying that I should just get over it. And that of course really helped. Just needed somewhere to let it out,"ok to let it out, here to listen and help you.PM if you want to talk. :)"
"I Have To Go To Work In Ten Minutes. But I haven't started getting dressed yet, or made any sort of effort to get ready to go. I just can't will myself to do it right now. I will, because I have to, but this is going to be a rough day.","Aye, it is. I feel the same way, I got hired 7 months ago, and was depressed for 2 years before that. I hate to admit this, but some days I cry like the little bitch I am in the shower and on my drive to work. But guess what, I haven't missed a single day of work aside from 9 day vacation that I took scattered here and there. I have seriously one simple trick: you go there no matter what, don't give yourself a choice. The more you sit and wonder the harder it gets. Funny thing, my supervisor almost cried today at work and was complaining in a high pitched voice xD. It kinda brightened my day LOL."
Help! My parents are moving apart.. I'm 17 yo. My parents have decided to move apart from Wednesday. I'm kind of destroyed by their move. There's a long story behind it. I have no time to type. I need them together. Please mom and dad. If you are reading this stay with me together.,"It's their relationship, not yours. How would you feel if they asked you to stay with someone because they liked that person?  I'm sure it's tough enough for them dealing with this. Give them your love and support instead."
Can depression just end?. Is there a way? Am I damned by this?,"I don't want to crumble your hopes but i believe that if somebody starts feeling depressed and they manage to get rid of it, i still think that those negative thoughts will always be in the back of your brain, because, somehow, they appeared there in the first place. Nobody is the same, hope you will get rid of it as soon as possible"
"I'm pathetic. If I see girls or anything about couples or marriage, I get super sad and feel like crying. My depression is just getting worse day by day.","Hey, I feel the same way. quite demoralizing to see everyone in a relationship when all you want at times. Most of my friends are in committed relationships. So, been times where I was the only single guy in the room. I say anything, but deep down it kind of hurts. I help but think I just I realize that not something I could say to anyone else. I could never look at anyone call them unlovable. So why can I say it myself? Why do we think such nasty thoughts about ourselves? My friend, you do deserve love, and I hope that it comes to you. :) Oh, and social media is terrible for this type of feeling btw. been staying off Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat lately. I now feel a lot more secure in my status as not constantly bombarded with pictures of happy couples (who are also usually just posing for the picture, sometimes they break up the next day)."
Waking life better better than sleeping life for anybody?. Because it's def not for this mid 20s manchild,"Yea. Especially since I regularly have lucid dreams. It's amazing, except when you wake up with a bitter taste in your mouth."
NEED HELP WITH SCHOOL. can someone plz do my math work for me just no advice just plz do it,If you feel like you are in over your talk to your teacher/professor and tell them struggling to handle the assignments. talk to your school/university about dropping your math class. see a counselor or psychologist at your school/university and see if you qualify for accommodations through student accessibility/disability services.
Should people have the right to commit suicide?. I wanna here your thoughts,Absolutely. Where I live I can be killed peacefully in a hospital if I have a terminal physical disease such as cancer. Depression/Anxiety is also terminal...it kills slower but it is just as painful in different ways.
it feels rlly good knowing everyone will be able to continue w/out me. peep me hanging on a noose by the spring time,Whats going on why do you think things would be better without you or why does it make you feel better to think that you will not be around anymore?
Nausea. I am the only one who feel this nausea 24/7??,Definitely anxiety related for me. usually okay but had a stressful night a few nights ago and just felt nauseous since. Gets really bad when just laying in bed to the point where I sleep cause I think gonna throw up hoping it passes soon
"Laying on floor all day.. been laying on the floor for hours.Its my day off and beautiful outside, but I want to get up,just laying in here.Some ants are in in my room and some crawl on me.Dont care, feel anything.",Do you have anyone you can call?
"im kinda okay.. Not really... I'm kinda sad, kinda lame, kinda scared, kinda sick, kinda tired, i kinda wanna die.",Yeah. I say I'm okay because getting help is scary and difficult.
its quite an interesting feeling starving yourself for a day. i guess dinner tonight will taste even better :D,"Yeah, happened to me aswell, it's quite interesting."
It just doesn't fucking end. I don't want to be here anymore.,"8 years of very severe, suicidal depression, I feel you, mate. I'm incredibly sorry."
I’m a fuck up. All I ever do is compare myself to others because the only way I get self worth. I was doing so fucking good and now back at square one,"I hear you. So well. And I'm so sorry you feel that way. I left my difficult-to-get-into art school because of this (and my classmates treated it like high school and were jerks, but thats irrelevant). It's not easy."
"Staring into Emptiness. I often find myself staring into space for some quite time without even thinking of anything. This happens to me in every kind of situation. Beeing at work. While browsing the Interwebs, even in middle of conversations. I stare and i freeze...you guys have the same thing goin on?","I daydream a lot, and I always have done. It doesn't mean you're depressed (it could be a symptom), but it could very well be something else? ADD? check it out with a doctor if you are worried :)"
I am beyond repair. And it is all thanks to Aspergers! This insufferable disorder has killed me. I feel broken. There is no hope.,"i hear you. i don't have aspergers, so i can't relate exactly, but i feel you. i have ocd and on the bad days, i'm a prisoner to my anxiety. here for you ! you aint alone and even the fact you're here talking on is a good thing. here for you, friend."
I'm so ready to die. There is nothing for me in this life,"but how can you play sims when you're dead? jokes aside, don't do anything okay, calm down. life will bring beauty, hang on."
Hate how sensitive I am. Wish I didn't care as much,Tbh. I used to hate being sensitive. But I love it now. And people need to be considerate of it! really a strength. Being sensitive makes your more empathetic (which is an amazing fucking quality to have!) and just really more in tune with the mood of the room. Do you know there are some people that just babble on and even ever tell that other stopped listening?? I know it sucks overthinking and constantly worrying. But being sensitive makes you a better human.
"It's Monday morning and I just feel like crying. Just as the title states, I dread Mondays. I am tired of putting a facade in front of everyone I meet in school.","Same here, Mondays even lead to me hating Sundays afternoon/evenings because since I'm in school Sunday is just supposed to be a workday to prepare for Monday. I usually wake up late on the weekends and never get anything done like I'm supposed to, so Mondays usually are stressful for me."
Can anyone remind me what happiness feels like?. Because I honestly cant remember.,"Jerk off or jill off. That moment of white empty bliss? That's happiness, a small time away from existence. It comes(hehe) in many forms but that's the easiest one."
"I feel like my depression is fucking up my sex life. I will literally be in bed with a girl who is going for it and I even find the motivation to try, even though I want to. Curious to see if this is a common thing or not",Libido goes early for me too
Suicide victims. Why do people blame suicide victims?,It really boils my blood when people do that. my mother tried to commit suicide and was in the hospital for a few days. My sister and uncle were just talking shit...ugh made me feel pretty furious. My mother has battled depression for sadly the great majority of her life. I cannot begin to understand her mental anguish yet it infuriates when I hear people talk shit about an already vulnerable person.
"What do you do when you are really depressed ? Any Ideas. Please share what you do when you are depressed, anything to get you out of the mood, maybe that helps. Thanks.",Listen to music full blast and cry for a bit.
"Anyone else completely useless to society?. I can't get myself to get a job. I dropped out of classes last semester. I do nothing all day but sleep, eat, and smoke pot.",I feel the exact same way. My ex girl friend broke up with me and got pregnant with another guy . Words can't describe what I went through. Atleast your not buying hard drugs right ? If you are I'm not judging you.
"I can't accept that anyone could ever love or care about me. I'm so lonely. I've been feeling awful because I just can't stop losing people in my life. No matter how hard I try, I'm always forgotten, abandoned, and replaced. I don't have any support at all. I'm tired of being lonely, and being lied to.","I feel the same. For years of isolation, now I don't know if I ever will find someone to love me, talk to me."
"How do people see the beauty in life?. I am just tired. Too tired to put up a fight living. I fail to see the beauty in living life. At this point, all I see are the hardships in life and the ugliness of everyone's personality... I don't know what to do anymore.",Buddhism would fit your life views and might help you with depression. Look into it. It's aimed at eliminating the suffering thing and moving towards constant unconditional satisfaction with life. P.S.: I promote Buddhism so much I might come across as sectarian lol.
"Sometimes there are actually some point in your life that you just want to close your eyes and forget about the world. I know I am depressed and I am actually doing everything to live a normal life. But there are a time that you will still be pulled back to the black hole. I really want to share everything, but I felt that it will still be useless at all. I feel that everything around me even my self and also all of the happenings in my life is useless and pointless. What a life I got. I literally laugh sarcastically about my life right now. What's this all about.","I'm sorry to hear how you're feeling right now, and although everything you do at the moment may feel pointless, there will come a time when your purpose will become apparent, and everything will hopefully make sense. All I can really say right now is to strive on, do the things that make you happy and cherish the people that make you feel loved. I wish you a wonderful future OP, and hope that one day everything will be better."
"How do you deal or what do you do when someone insults you on the internet?. Like on YouTube, Facebook, Discord, etc...?","I guess. Just don't respond to them, because that's exactly what they want"
How do you get through bad days?. having an exceptionally bad day today and having trouble getting through it. afraid this feeling ever go away.,"Write down how you feel, to get all your thoughts out. It doesn't have to be organized or creative"
Isn't it crazy that I'm just so tired means something else. I can't explain it really,No need to explain. I know exactly what you mean. I'm tired too.
Going to end it soon. I'm an 18 year old kissless virgin. I'll probably die alone becuase all the cute girls are dumb. I think I'm going to end it soon. Going to cut tonight. I hate life.,Not really.... some of them do. And those people will end up not doing much with thier lives. Do you have any passions? what are you doing with schooling? Work towards earning a fuck tonne of money so that you have power and money when you are older.
It just doesn't fucking end. I don't want to be here anymore.,"I know this feeling all too well. The last six months for me have been the absolute worst in many many different ways. You don't get healed -- ever -- but you get something better if you can just force yourself to ride it out. What you're feeling now gets compressed and you're able to focus and use it to enact whatever changes you need in your life. One thing I feel like you really need to hear is that you deserve better, a lot better than what you've been getting. You're not worthless, you don't have to settle, you should be treated better, you should own a big piece of this world instead of being crushed by it."
I don't have one single friend. Every weekend/day I'm sat alone in my room watching youtube. My life is awful.. Another weekend and not a message from anyone. I feel like I'm going to have a nervous breakdown.,Hope you start feeling better and life gets less awful
"My friend knows that I am depressed and suicidal, yet he keeps on telling me that I chose to be sad everyday. I don't know what to think about that? Is it really an option I make everyday?. Is it bad that I think I chose to be depressed now?","No, depression isn't a choice. You can't control it."
"Having a box of things that contain things that holds sentimental value to you.. You know, the thing about having a box that keeps things that hold sentimental value to you is that over time, it goes from a box of promises to a box of unfulfilled promises.","A friend of my mine gave me a stupid novelty soda a few months ago. He was moving, and he told me he'd thought it'd make me chuckle once or twice. It did. I thought it was funny, and I appreciated that he had thought of me instead of just throwing it away. He hasn't talked to me in a month. I see it on a table in my room every day and I'm hit by how much I am going to miss him. How much I do miss him. I'm going to put the bottle in his car tomorrow. I'm tired of crying over him."
"I may be a hot mess, but at least I'm hot. The optimistic look at having Anxiety and Depression",in that case i'm a cold mess.
"What's your most wackiest side effect of depression med?. I used ti take Prozac, which drove my sex drive crazy. Now I switched to Lexapro, I have near zero sex drive. Hows yours?",Abilify caused akathisia which is a severe form of restless leg. I was close to chopping off my legs...
"A broken soul. I think caring about someone, and they are your world and everything to you and then realising you are nothing to them hurts the most in the world. Then, when you get replaced so easily by someone else it feels like someone is stabbing you in the chest.","Yes. I'm going through this exact scenario right now. It's causing me to question my entire reality with him. It's such an earth shattering feeling. Like, what else can I not trust in my world? The worst part was that in my gut, I knew it. I've known it for longer than I've wanted to admit. I just hoped I was wrong and let myself get sucked in even further. I believed all the bullshit just because maybe he meant it when he told me he loved me. He didn't mean it. I can't comprehend doing that to someone I loved. So I totally understand how you feel. I'm here if you want to talk."
"Something that kept me going.. Depression has already fked my past, I won't let it do the same to my future.",I remember this one! Keep fighting!
"Cried myself to sleep last night.. I felt empty. broke, hungry, cold, and alone. It sucks","Life sucks, but that doesn't mean to give up. Try to overcome your feelings."
Why does sadness feel like home?. I get this sounds so weird but I have always drawn so much more creativity from my depression and sadness. I feel more comfortable when I'm melancholy or sad. Being happy feels weird and it is draining. Sadness is my comfort and i hate that.,"Because sadness often feels both familiar and comfortable (like you said), and trying to make yourself happy can be a scary thing because of the uncertainty that might come afterwards."
DAE get ready even if they have no place to go?. Sometimes just putting on makeup and nice clothes makes me feel better even though I'm just sitting at home alone. Does this help anyone else? Maybe one day I'll actually get up and go out.,"I get showered and dressed every day. It's a habit I work hard not to break, just so I can go out if I'm able. It definitely helps me"
Help me.. Please someone anyone out there help me.,Yes hunny what you need?
"I got beaten today. It doesn't really matter, I ran out of the house and stayed to rot on the streets, if the police didn't stop me I wouldn't have been alive. I don't have a will to live I'm killing mysel this week. Life is not worth living","Don't say it does get better. You don't know. You don't know his life, you don't know his past, his environment, nothing, how in the world could you make a statement that yes, rejoice, his life WILL undoubtedly get better? That's a very corrosive statement to make which DOES NOT HELP the person you're telling it to. For OP. Could you maybe find a reason to live in the fact that if you get out of this abusive life you're living in and build a life that you're proud of, that will show your family how better of a person you are than them? Would you find comfort and maybe willpower in that?"
"Anyone else wants to die?. I am 22 and fed up of this world, I just want to die, anyone else thinks the same?","I sometimes have thoughts like that, but I would never kill myself. P.S. Just a tip, be careful about writing such stuff on the internet. Lots of asshole white knights out there that will call the cops on you to protect you from yourself, even if you aren't actually suicidal. If you think your life is bad, imagine your life on forced medication and in psychiatry with lots of assholes telling you what to do all day and treating you like a child. Don't trust people on the internet."
"I dont remember what it feels like to be happy.. If a big part to getting on the right path to happiness is learning to love yourself, what does someone do if the thing they hate most is themself? Honestly, how do you love something that is polar opposite of what love represents?","What DO you love? Is there something you are passionate about? Something (other than another person, as people are inconstant and often unreliable) that you are passionate about? Self destruction takes a lot of energy. If you can refocus it on creation (of almost anything other than say, slashes on your wrists) it might help you. This is how I have found peace. When I feel the monster stirring I write it poetry and kiss it goodnight. I hope the best for you."
I'm thinking about checking myself into a hospital. Any advice?. I can't take this anymore. Thanks in advance.,"Right or wrong, we must choose. If we choose not to decide, then we still have made a choice. I say you should go for it. No matter how harsh the road we're on, we'll reach the end of we keep moving forward. However, It's not necessary for us to try and brave the conditions alone. I wish you the best."
I don't care about anything. I don't have a job but I don't care. I can't pay my bills but I don't care. I'm ruining my relationship but I don't care. I'm not healthy but I don't care. I don't want to be around anyone. I don't even want to exist.,"If there is one thing I encourage you to care about, it's your relationship. Depressed people can't make it on their own. Please understand that feeling this way is all the proof you need that you need help."
I don’t understand. I understand how a single person on this earth can be happy. I how anybody at all could even want to stay alive. Is anybody happy? Am I just weak? Does everybody feel this way?,I'm not very happy but I distract myself with hobbies and projects. I'm just used to being single.
"DAE ever go into psychotic laughing fits by your self. Just laying is bed, reflecting on life. Then you start laughing pretty hard because you realize just how fucked it all is.",I have a time or two....it feels good.
"I want to end my life. I even know why, I feel so much that I feel anymore",sick of life as well. I want to go to school tomorrow. I just want to sleep for all eternity.
Should I make everyone hate me before I die?. Maybe I don't even need to,"No, I basically did this and dug myself into a much deeper hole to climb out of."
"Attempt. Been really depressed lately, tried to od earlier, but all it did was get me high. When i was high i didn't even feel good i just felt numb and just as shit as i did before. My life isn't getting any better.","Please be safe and seek help. I have been really depressed and lonely before where I tried what you tried. I took over 20+ pills trying to OD to end up at the doctors with them believing it was a virus. I also tried cutting but I was too scared of the pain. I lived through the loneliness and pain only to be depressed again, but I came to a realization- I deserve better and I am worth it. It's definitely hard and a battle everyday, but with professional help, I am getting better day by day. You deserve better and you are worth it. Please stay strong and I do hope you talk to someone to get the help you need."
Feeling lonely and would love to hear about why you feel depressed and I’ll tell how I feel. The title says it all. Just pm me if interested,"Haha, how much time you got?"
"I wish I could enjoy my safe haven (my bed), but instead I feel guilty for spending so much time here. Anyone else feel the guilt?",I just love being in my bed all day.. It really does make me feel guilty though. I have so much I should be doing but I can't get myself to. I just love it though laying here with my dog.
I want to love myself so much. ....but I just can't. My depression brain won't let me.,i feel the same way. i know what i need to do but i just cant and that kills me even more
I just want to sleep. I don't know if I'm weak or crazy and I can't tell which is worse,You're probably not weak or crazy just sleepy
baffled. Does love even exist? like true actual love? halfway convinced that it,"Love does exist. But our modern unrealistic rendition of what it is aka the so-called Real Love unfortunately doesn't. Humans are fallible and imperfect. We can't expect them to have emotions that are perfect let alone those that remain constant forever. That said, if you go in a relationship where you both embrace each other's imperfections and be honest then I don't know if it will be perfect but at least you won't drown in regrets and disappointments if it breaks up. And maybe you'll end up being happy"
"I cry until tears refuse to come out. All my memories are coming back. I remember every detail. God, why did this happen. Why is this happening? I suspect my childhood did this. It's hard to stay calm. Please stop now.",Fight to make tomorrow a memory you want to have.
Do you go through phases of insomnia and excessive sleep??. Is it normal to alternate between getting barely any sleep at night and not being very tired to the other extreme of sleeping 10-12 hours then napping most of day? I usually alternate between the two. Depression symptoms say increase sleep or decrease sleep. But not both. So I was wondering if any else experiences this.,"Bad insomnia is usually one of the first indicators of an oncoming episode. I truly wish I had hypersomnia though, the few times I got it, I wasn't rested whatsoever but I loved those little moments you have when you wake up and you can feel yourself drifting off to sleep. A feeling I've felt rarely in my 10 year struggle with insomnia alone."
four-hour-long panic attack last night for the win. does this mean i get some sort of medal ??,"Yes, a know how the fuck you survived that but so fucking strong have an anxiety endured award"
Can you will yourself to die. I'd really like.to not wake up tomorrow,"Aw don't bc you pass the depression on. I'd kill myself if I opps someone out of thier life, know what I mean. If I could just stop this depressive shit by just me living it last I'd do it even though this SUCKS!! Be safe"
"How badly will i emotionally kill my loved ones, if i commit suicide?. I don't want to imagine them all crying badly.","This is how I look at it. Someone who is truly amazing in your life will change you into a new you. If that someone leaves you life somehow, you are still the new you. You still have a little bit of that someone inside of you. Once you die, that little bit of them dies inside of you as well. Do you respect those people who changed you in your life? Do you respect them enough to keep them with you? Those are the thoughts I think when I am ready to end it. Hopefully it helps you, friend."
You guys ever just daydream too much?. I would always sit in class and daydream about some happy events that took place in my life and i realize they wont ever come back to me.,Yep I do the same thing myself.
Admitted to hospital for first time.. Almost killed myself last night. This isn't even the saddest I've been. But it's the most tired I have been. I'm just tired of dealing with it. It's obnoxious. I just want to sleep forever.,"Hospital stays can be helpful or horrible, depending on the staff and services provided. I hope things go OK for you while you're there. I've been where you've been. I don't know if it gets better, but you're not alone."
"Accepting fate. Has anyone else accepted that this is it, and then you die? I'm almost looking forward to it at this point. Let's just get it the fuck over with.","I sincerely hope you aren't talking about suicide. If you aren't, then I think accepting depression is like accepting a loss without even trying to fight it. I've had depression for a couple of years now, and giving up seems like the only option most of the time but at some point I understood that there is at least one person that will care about you. You don't need to talk to them about it to know that they care, you just realize at one point that they enjoy being with you, and that you enjoy being with them, and if you aren't going to fight it for yourself, you should do it for them."
"Apparently I should be happy that not everyone at work hates me. I had lunch with a colleague today at his invitation. After I returned to work, a fellow colleague asked where had I been and I accordingly told him. He then said, not everyone hates I am so glad.","Hm. I think they were just trying to make an off-hand joke or something. Sometimes (most of the time) co-workers berate each other. It's all banter most of the time. But if he took the time and interest to ask where you've been, I don't think he hates you. I understand why it upsets you, people like us, most people with depression, hang on to the little negative things throughout their day that most people brush off, and they eat away at us. But I want you to know, that it's okay. If it really made you uncomfortable, confront him / her about it. Or talk to HR if you want. Or your boss, or whomever. But don't hold a grudge against him / her. They most likely just didn't know how it would affect you. :c But das okay, because we're all here for you ^-^"
"Yes, I know that exercise helps with depression. No, I don't have the motivation to do it.. This is a viscous cycle lads",I do it because it gets me tired. It also kind of makes me forget about it for a while. It wears me down.
Honestly I feel terrible. I feel like running a marathon my entire fucking life and I remember a single time where it like this. Can someone listen to me and console me before I fucking cut myself,"Please don't cut yourself. You can post more about your situation, I'm sure there are always people in this sub that will offer a listening ear. I would."
I hate school. School just reminds me what a failure I am,Yes it can be. I feel the exact same.
I'm just tired of being tired. What the title says. I'm just beat.,That makes me tired just hearing that. Feel free to message me if you want to vent. a good listener
I'm giving up on my relationship. I'm not gonna be the one doing all the romantic gestures. I'm done being the one always trying to do something. I'm done caring. If she won't make me a priority I'm not gonna make her one. Well see how she'll feel about it,"I do understand why upset. You pour your heart and soul out and do everything you can in order to make that special person happy. But keep in mind that they ask you to go above and beyond. That was a choice you made. not fair to expect them to reciprocate when the one who wanted to pamper them... I think that instead of trying to you should voice your thoughts to her. You can explain how you feel. That you hope they can try to be more ... affectionate, attentive, appreciative, etc. This is a relationship. Communication is so important but more importantly is respect for each other. If u care about her try and make her sad because hurt. And sometimes it takes time for a relationship to build trust and affection. Some people as good at dating as others. I hope doing okay whether you stay with her or not."
i wanna kill myself then kill myself again. holy fuck i hate this so much,"Idk why twice, but seriously, i wish you the best to get through this, even though idk what this may be Also i loved atla too, even though i watched it years after it aired"
"I don’t want to die, I just want to stop existing. Does anyone else just want to stop existing? Like you want to die because you know it will hurt the people around you who love you, but you want to live anymore? Sometimes I just wish I ever born.",&gt; Sometimes I just wish I ever born. Only sometimes? :S
Anyone else feel like they'll never actually find their purpose in life. Like you will never find the one that you absolutely love to do and will want to do for the rest of your life. You just aimlessly float lost in the world.,"All. The. Time. I have a job that affords me an easy lifestyle but is basically meaningless. An easy relationship for which I should have no complaints but doesn't challenge me. No real talents or super interesting hobbies. So... what am I doing? And why am I doing it? Been trying lately to shift my focus from finding my purpose to finding a purpose somewhere. It's a subtle difference but eases some of the hopeless sting of everyday life. Perhaps I missed my chance or my calling for something great, but I still have a sphere of influence in which I can affect the world and others around me."
"What does it feel like to be in love while depressed?. To be quite frank, I don't know what love feels like without the complications depression tends to bring with it. Any insights or descriptions would be helpful.","For me, it's like I like someone and we can be great, but I always feel nervous, I second guess everything, I feel like I'm never good enough, like they're gonna leave me at any point"
4mg xanax goodnight everyone. Hopefully at least get through the night this time without waking up.,Feel you bro... Wish I had some xanax to go numb..
"What situations tend to trigger depression when you've been feeling relatively good?. Sometimes I'll be feeling decent, like a normal person and then some stupid thing happens and I become extremely depressed and sometimes suicidal. What situations do that to you?","Work, and I'm always here :( it's like a big prison."
What is it like to be happy?. Can't remember the last time I was honestly.,I also wish to know!
Going Bananas. Does anyone ever feel like they get near the precipice of a psychotic break and just barely pull yourself away from the edge?~Askingforafriend,Nope. I fell completely over the edge three times. But I'm feeling much better now.
"People are moving on, and living a good life, and me, am stuck here doing nothing.. I feel so isolated, and alone.","Know the feeling. My friends are married, they have kids, have homes of their own. Meanwhile, I'm still at home with my parents wondering what the fuck happened to my life at 31? But as others have said, Facebook is pretty much a crock of shit. I recently decided to out myself for being the manic depressive I am. Some people were kind about it, others pretended they gave a shit (more likely for the look how sympathetic I am play card.) Recently I've been pretty out with my highs and lows. My highs get a lot of love but as soon as I show my lows, I notice a massive difference in support. It's almost like they go out of their way to avoid the lows and reality of it. So yeah, Facebook is pretty much a crock of shit and it really does expose to you who people really are."
My life is falling apart and it's all my fault.. The world would be better off without me.,No it wouldn't. What happened?
"Once upon a time I was very passionate, it's hard for me to see how much I've changed.. I used to think that I could change the world, but now it seems to be a more attractive option to commit suicide than to get up in the middle of the day and begin to do my responsibilities.","What convinced you you In my case, I had been working hard on my career but my supervisors needed to cut me off (they had a year on me but I was on their level of skill). I realized that the most important thing in the world to be taken away from me or controlled by others and that I do anything about it. Classic case of with power do what they can, those without suffer what they felt pretty pointless since."
"You know it’s going to be a good day when you just stand in the shower with your head down for half an hour. I even know what it is anymore, I just wish I awake",That was me this morning. I felt way alone but better now
Does anyone else just count the hours left until it's time to go back to bed?. Only 12 more to go!,"I used to watch alot, but i struggle to keep my concentration now. I just end up listening to music all day. any ideas?"
"Is panic and helplessness a symptom of depression?. Because that has become my main pain, the lethargy and suffering is something I have actually gotten used to, but the panic is unbearable. Anyone?","Have you sought any professional help? I used to be depressed and lethargy and a lack of motivation were a large part of that. But to me, panic seems to be indicative of an anxiety disorder. If you can seek therapy and possibly some medication to improve your life, please do so."
"I put away the dishes, vacuumed my rug, made my bed and finished my homework today. It's the little victories sometimes.","That's an accomplishment for most of the population to be honest. You had a productive day, be proud of yourself."
I just want to be happy again.. Where did it all go so wrong. I miss my old self. I'm so afraid I'll never be me again.,Can you recall times of your old self when you were happy? Was there a particular activity you did that made you happy? Identifying those activities/ hobbies while exploring new ones could help. Has there been a big life change between then and now?
"I feel absolutely nothing. 3 years of being on Zoloft and i feel nothing, no emotions of anysort ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. I sometimes think i shoud be feeling a certain way in certain situations. Its really affecting my life in the way of relationships. Has anyone else had a similar experience?","Kind of like you're a walking zombie? That's why I got off it, I felt that it helped with my emotions, by completely eliminating any emotions I could feel."
"I just want to know who I am. I wanna peel and scrape away the layers of skin until I find myself... Nothing feels real anymore. Not even things, food, alcohol, places, people or parties, fun videos or the small things. Nothing comforts me anymore. Anyone else stuck in this way of thinking?","Yes, tried to commit suicide before. I know how you feel, as if trapped in a concept, and you feel numb, or no reaction to anything. a hard time to go through and really nothing you can do, except love yourself."
Can anyone recommend a SAD lamp?. that turns on at a set time every morning. TIA,Get some full spectrum LEDs bulbs. Works great
if you keep on pushing people away and keep on doing this and that you will end up being alone. and i am alone now. i have lost everyone...,"Oh yes, I have heard this many times. The trouble is that no one has bothered to follow that statement up with *how* I push people away. You know? Like, the first time someone said it to me I had no idea it was even a thing I did, but they give me any feedback. Anyone else in the same boat? Point is, OP, I feel ya. And a sore spot."
"Since I can't say it to anybody anymore. I love you, I hope you have a great day..",This hit me. I hope that I stay with my so and be able to say this to them everyday
"I’m sorry I’m too depressing, don’t hate me.. I think I could blame you if you did though","I've felt obligated to say that to friends for so long. But a lot of them (the good, right ones) insist I don't. Because I've been there for them, they should never argue I'm too much for them if I do the same. Just know anyone who cares for you will help you."
I am fucked what do i do. math exam coming up this week and i have no idea how to math at all everytime in class i try really hard to focus but i never just listen i dont know what to do i dont know anything im so dumb im gonna flunk,"you clearly dont wanna do the math. if its for high school or some compulsory assessment, you just gotta power through it and flunk and keep moving forward away from it. if its something you chose to do, you gotta change cos theres nothing worse than being stuck doing something you hate. figure out why you are gonna flunk it, cos it makes all the difference if its something you just dont wanna do. if youre getting down about it you gotta figure out why it means so much to you. good luck i hope it goes ok anyway."
"Does anyone ever wake up in the morning with a tinge of happiness? Then, suddenly, you remember that you're sad and subsequently go back to your depressive mood...?. Just wondering, as it's like a false sense of hope...","It happens to me quite often. Sometimes I'm just having just another 'regular day' in which I'm busy doing work and stuff. Suddenly I realize that I'm feeling fine or even happy, and that's when all the 'bad thoughts' and 'reasons to be worried or sad' storm in. I really don't know how to deal with them. I wish I could find a way. I know I've lived through some stuff that still weighs on me and I know that time helps to ease the pain, but it's really difficult to keep it together sometimes; and being unable to enjoy the little things of each day makes it frustrating in some way. I hope that you'll find a way around it!"
"We can't all be winners. Maybe I'm just supposed to lose? As I'm nearing my 30's hope is making way for resignation. More and more milestones are being passed unsuccessfully and less milestones remain. I know we can't all be the winners, there must be losers too. You can say that the losers are merely the ones who didn't want success hard enough but, realistically, I think it's safe to say some losers are just unlucky. I have never been exceptional in a positive sense, though I have failed spectacularly. I don't dream of greatness anymore, I dream of becoming mediocre and even that is slipping away these days. I have no job, lost my relationship, no degrees, no skills and a bad body. We all see resignation as a taboo, but how long does a person have to fail before it becomes evident that person will fail until he, she, they or whatever else will continue to fail, lose and forfeit until they are dead? I am a born loser, my life and death will both be equally disappointing.",There are losses worth fighting for
How do you cope. with a messed up family/school environment?,Just do the best you can in life :))
I hate apathy.. I feel so disinterested in everything. The things I am interested in doing costs money. I can't work due to physical and mental issues so I'm stuck waiting on SSI. It's annoying and kinda crushing.,"You sound like my kind of person. What are you making? Also hope you enjoy the H3H3 podcast, going to listen to it in a bit myself."
"My birthday's coming up. In less than a month now. I'll be 35. While I have a good job that I really like, and I've taken charge of my life by finally pursuing the hobbies I've wanted to, I still feel lonely and unsuccessful. I don't want to be depressed on my birthday","hey, happy early birthday! treat yourself to something, even if it's something little."
"I'd like to write here how miserable i feel, blah, blag, but tbh, probably you all will ignore this.. My head hurts and I am sleepless. And ma thoughts sucks, like everything about me. And some more as well, but does it matter? Either way, you won't help me, you won't cheer me.","Hmm, well I've had a horrible day. But tell me what's up, and I won't stop responding , I promise. Trusting a stranger is difficult, but I'm here for you. So try to trust."
It's not that there aren't any people to help me. It's that I don't think I deserve their help,"I always feel awful by bothering other people with my issues, I just feel like such a burden, and sure when you say that to someone they say that it's not the case... but idk I guess people are too busy with their lives, and it's really my fault to be bothered by it so much. Like why do I have the need to want to share my problems, but hide them away at the same time? Man I'm sorry it's such a crappy feeling to have, just feeling undeserving of anything."
Broke my self harm streak. I feel so shitty right now and have no one to call. I hurt myself for the first time in years and feel even more like shit for doing that. Ugh.,"I'm so sorry you feel that pain. I know that pain all too well. That's amazing that you went so long without it! I can hardly manage three months, and I've been doing it for years. It's hard not to do it when you have no one to talk to. You are fine. People slip up here and there."

"You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today. *And then one day you find ten years have got behind you.

I'm 21 and too young to feel this old.","thats a great question, wish there was an answer"
Depressed that I'll never find love.. My biggest fear is not finding love.I see all of my friends having girlfriends and stuff and I am sitting here and wasting my time doing nothing.I've had a few relationships but all of them crashed and burned.,Well you've had a few. I doubt any of us gets a bulls eye on the first shot. Some of us never even had a chance. Give it time.
"Not good enough to be depressed?. Does anyone else ever feel guilty because their problems aren't as big as other people's problems so they shouldn't be depressed? I feel this heaps and it just makes me feel worse, feel like I'm stuck in between.","everyone has problems, big or small, Whatever it is, its still a problem. Yes there is a certain degree of separation but dont think for a second because someone else is suffering more than you, That you have no right to express yourself. So what's the matter? do you want to talk about it? Were here for you :) Don't feel shy or embarrassed. Just remember one thing, If you allow this problem or problems to dwell for a long time, It will become worse."
"Struggling with depression and anxiety. I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for over 2 years now. It gotten to the point that I can't control it anymore.

Sorry you're going through this, friend"
"I just want a hug. My family isn't at home right now and I'm feeling really sad. I wish I could have a hug from any of them, kinda need one :(","*hug* I can't remember the last time someone apart from my mom hugged me either, I need a hug or a cuddle so bad, the lack of intimacy with anyone is killing me. I feel incredibly lonely and empty all the time. I don't know how long I can go on. Best of luck!"
Just got fired from my job. It absolutely sucks. I really hate this feeling. I feel I was misled astray. I am numb and feel like my wife thinks I am a failure... Very depressed.,"Think of it as this way, you provide a service and they compensate you for that service, its a contract. You getting fired, is just the termination of that contract, and thats it. Take your services elsewhere. Have you used indeed.com before? check it out, you might find something interesting."
"I love being drunk.. I don't know how I survived before I started drinking. The more liquor I drink, the better I feel. If I drink enough, eventually I get to a state where I stop hating myself like a normal, well adjusted person.",It does feel like the human race doesn't suck as much when I'm drunk. I actually enjoy listening to what people have to say. I enjoy doing the stuff that brought me happiness when I was younger. Sucks I can't be drunk at work.
"I actually did something today!. I fucking finally cleaned my room and did some laundry! I know this is barely anything and kind of pathetic, but it feels really good and I wanted to share with someone who might understand. I hope tomorrow is like this, but I'm not exactly hopeful","Good work. Don't just hope for a good tomorrow, make it happen. Life doesn't happen to you, you happen to it. I know sometimes energy and motivation level feels out of your control, but sometimes when you're feeling low that's actually the most important time to get up and move. Today you just experienced how getting things done is what made you feel good. Too many people want to feel good first, and then act. Most times it works in the opposite way, act first and feel good after. You don't have to be at the mercy of waiting for these random days when you suddenly get something done. Make it happen. Life is like a game of momentum and inertia. Even doing something small is better than nothing. I like the mentality of trying not to have any Zero days. Don't let a day go by where you did absolutely nothing productive. It only takes something small to qualify as more than zero. And then it becomes fun trying to keep going and not letting any days slip by. Setting small goals is a good way to get moving. Large goals can seem overwhelming. Trick yourself by saying you're just going to start with 5 minutes, and often times you'll end up doing a lot more."
Just how exactly could i lift myself up from all the bullshit currently in my life.. I've honestly tried everything and nothing seems to work,You're thinking is pretty warped. You haven't tried everything that's clealry illogical. How have those things failed? Seems isn't a definitive answer. Are there specific things you tried for a set period of time and the outcome never changed? Dealing with depression isn't what it looks like. There's no magic set of actions that make it go away. You learn to tolerate it better and manage your mood. What do you think you need the most help with?
I hate myself. I want to free myself from my body. I want to stop being a complete and utter failure. Pills aren't working anymore.,Sounds like your having a tough go. So am I and misery loves company. Do you have a doctor who can look at trying something else?
"Does anyone look at articles about how to tell if someones depressed just for the heck of it. I look at them sometimes so i can just feel like im doing something right,",No i dont want to read about myself id just get more bummed
"I hate myself. I'm the only one in my family who's ugly, I'm the only one in my family with no skill. I feel like everyone is judging/mocking me. I wish I was never born.",Ugly is very subjective.

What qualifies for an emergency therapist visit?. I really need to see someone. I just want to know before I call.,"Have you seen what kind of idiots call 911? They're out of waffles! apparently is considered to be a good reason to ring them up these days! So, yeah, I'm sure the 911/112/999 operator won't be angry because you called, in fact, they'll be glad to help. You have a medical emergency - they have medical assistance available. End of story. But be honest with whoever ends up helping you. Don't bottle up your feelings, let them know why you called and what's up."

"I'm not afraid of dying, I'm afraid that when I try to kill myself I'll accidentally survive.. I can't handle the hospital bills, plus the mandatory 72 hours. I can't have certain jobs after that. I just want to be dead, but I don't have access to a gun (the easiest method). I push away everyone I love and I don't know how to stop. I just want to love. I just want to love and I want to know why I'm so broken. edit: I'm just gonna distract myself as much as possible and go to the gym so often that I begin fainting randomly and maybe I'll take care of myself. Maybe I'll lose some fucking weight in the meantime.","You writing this &amp; still being here I think that's a good sign,I think it means that deep down there's still hope that things will get better &amp; you'll start feeling happier &amp; less lonely, hold on to that feeling &amp; if you ever feel like talking feel free to message me."
"Anybody else's depression occur only at night?. Sun falls, and my bad thoughts race. 8pm is when I take my anti-depressants. Maybe that is a factor?","I'm not sure I can say I have depression but yeah, during the day I'm too busy."
"They gave me meds, but now it's harder to cry. I still feel empty inside.. Is it weird that I miss crying...",Meds numb the sadness and make it possible to break the circle. Look at what made you cry. Work with a therapist to fill the emptiness. It's a cance not a punishment.
Im failing life. Im failing and losing like in everything.,Same. And im not gonna stop failing anytime soon
I just wanna hug someone and cry. I wasn't like this. Fuck this,"Same, but I have nobody I'd be comfortable with hugging so occasionally I just lie down and cry by myself."
"the strain is becoming too much. not too sure how much longer i can keep doing this. my caring for everything, and everyone, has disappeared completely. what do i do when i care about nothing at all, anymore, and have no motivation to do anything except sleep",Sometimes we need to start with ourselves. Do you think you provide yourself with the care you need? It is alright to lose care for things and people at times because that only tells us that we might need to look out for ourselves first.
"When I’m at home, I get sad that I’m missing the life out there, but when I go out, all I wanna do is get back home. Does anyone feel the same way?","Staying at home: regret. Loneliness. Going out: pain, anxiety. Even more loneliness when being in a crowd and having nobody to talk to. I forced myself out again and again to _some_ social events that I can do and that also advance me. Where I actually can talk to people."
I feel like I'm so depressed that it's hard to even pretend to be happy. Does anyone else feel this way?,"Pretending to be happy can be extremely hard, no matter if depressed or not. Sure, depression doesn't make it any easier, thats a fact. Do you have someone you can talk to? For example have a really deep conversation, tell them about your biggest fears? Where you dont have to pretend to be happy? Wearing a mask is exhausting as hell, and the longer you try to keep it up, the more explosive will it be, when you can't hold it up any longer. In that regard, I speak from experience. And last but not least, it's completely fine to not feel happy sometimes. You just have to feel sad, out of the loop, neglected, rejected or even hated sometimes. Those are the moments where you really analyze yourself and your doings, (something you should keep under control, because too much of it is destructive), and if you embrace it, roll with it, telling yourself that this is natural and just a response of something inside you, you can't really pinpoint yet, those times could actually end up being beneficial for you. Noone feels 100% happy all the time, and if so, I'd call them liars. If you want, shoot me a pm, anytime! Keep your head up! please!"
Help. Can you withdrawal from Zoloft,Yes possible.. are you having withdrawal symptoms?
"I had to drag myself out of bed, then I cut myself. For the first time in a month","Hi, I just relapsed too. You're so much stronger than you think--I haven't been able to beat a month since November but maybe I will now that I'm back to seeing a therapist again. Have you considered seeing someone to talk about this?"
Why do you guys think the reason is for the steady increase in child suicides?. What do you guys think is fueling this behavior? Are kids learning about it earlier? Are they grasping a sense of time and being earlier? Have family situations or bullying gotten worse? Share your opinions!,"People are being exposed to the harsh reality of life earlier, thanks to the availability and ease of access of information."
How?. How do you start to love yourself when you have hated yourself for so long? It's been a very long time since I've been happy... I want that to change. I feel like I'm buried 12 feet under and I can't get out...,Talking to a professional can help. It's a common question and I'm sure most would have good advice. There's a book called '10 days (maybe steps) to self esteem by a dr. Burns I believe. It's like a workbook. It helped me quite a bit.
How do people work 8 hours a day?. I just did 4 hours of volunteer work and I'm absolutely shattered and exhausted. How on earth do people do twice that and every day? Am I just a faulty weak human? Because that's what it feels like. Do they just get used to it over time and that's why I'm struggling because I'm not used to it? FML.,"Woohoo, slaving so I can"
The rare moments I leave my depression are worse. I only realize how far I've fallen behind.. Depression is better than anxiety for me.,"You realize what s wrong. There's many things wrong and even though you're depressed you are comfortable in some way. Because realizing you must change your ways, can put some one in a discomfort zone. Truth is, you have to leave your comfort zones behind sometime in order to work on your happiness. An example Some one who is desperately trying to lose wieght will put himself ahead with a struggle to his mind and body, but he knows that the outcome is what matters. He has to deal with discomfort to loose his wieght. There's no other way, that's just how life is. A surgery to lose wieght would be a pass. There's no free passes or shortcuts in life and many learn the hard way."
Do you ever feel like you want your life to be over but you don’t want to do it yourself ? Coz same. Like you bring yourself to actually kill your self so you hope you get run over. Or someone else does it for you? I want to be alive and this is literal torture,"Same, I just wish for an alien invasion or a cataclysm to happen soon."
What is life about?. Why am I even still alive?,"Life isn't about anything (or maybe it is?), but I think what makes it meaningful are the little moments, the little things. Like a cup of tea on a chilly day, petting your dog while lying in a soft bed, this sort of stuff. Unfortunately they don't make the hardships and the sadness any easier."
"Forgotten how it's like to feel normal. After having mental health issues for the past 5 years, i don't even know how it's like to feel normal.

What has helped your depression?. Is anyone cured or nearly recovered?,"Definitely not cured, but much better than my worst. I've found that forcing myself to do the things I used to love, even if it only holds my interest briefly, helps on bad days. I have also found music to be a great mood changer and excerise if I can force myself to do it."
I told my psychiatrist that depression memes were a thing. Just waiting for him to find r/2meirl4meirl,But subs like /r/dragonsfuckingcars totally don't right?
"Terrible way of coping. I know this makes me look like a douche, but can anyone relate when I say I cope by sexting online. It seems like a bad addiction to me, if anybody can relate, can you help out.","...not sure I see the problem as long as its consensual? But if it's something you want to change, sure, I can try to help. What do you feel like you get out of it? How does sexting make you feel better?"
"Sadness is often caused by a discrepancy between where you are and where you want to be Help. What if your life has unmet expectations, that will never be realized. Since my first memory I've been distant, depressed, passive and unhappy for this reason. I'm old enough to realize now that this will never go away. I can't let go, it has gotten worse with unfortunate life events(lost the opportunity of a life time that will never be recovered). I just can't stop wanting change, change that doesn't exist in this world. Therapy didn't work, meds are uncertain because studies keep pointing towards how bad or ineffective they are and I don't want to risk it for the long term anyways, meditation helped a bit but it will never fill this void that I have. Life has become unbearable and I am already past the human will power. People think that this temporary, I've been doing research on the internet every night for the past 5 years and I came to the conclusion that it is not. Mercy on my tormented mind","That is a very true definition of sadness. Just out of curiosity, why wouldn't you want to take a risk of trying different medications that might help you? You don't know how they affect you, until you try them. You state that things are unbearable now, so it seems worthwhile to try something that might help you to be happier - even if it causes a side effect of growing a 2nd big toe on your right foot! :)  The internet is hard to scientifically research complicated subjects. Most of the better data &amp; studies are not accessible or behind paywalls.  I hope that you are feeling a little better. We get new opportunities every day, but it is hard to get over mistakes in the past sometimes. Unfortunately, we can't change the past, until I finish the time machine that I'm working on in my basement. :) Feel free to contribute to my Kickstarter fundraiser! :)"
Does telling someone help?. Does telling someone you're depressed help?,"It certainly doesn't hurt, given that you tell someone who is halfway decent. I find it to be a huge relief when I can talk to someone about it. It's like breathing fresh air after being in a sewer for a long time. Telling a the few close friends I have has actually strengthened our friendship as well."

Another birthday without anyone remembering. I love my life so much what did I do to deserve such a life,As you get older you might be glad to find them not remembered. I think it's important to not rely on external validation (easy to say right?) but also to provide that support to others. Let's say you try to make to recognise the birthday or other significant event for at least two other people you know this year.... I don't know if that will help.
can't sleep. fuckkkk and all I can think about is my ex who doesn't give a fuck about me. I can't take it.,I know the feeling. Time heals wounds brother....
"My life is falling apart.. I'm currently a sophomore in high school, and my life is already spiraling out of control I lost most of my friends, and it's really difficult for me to make more. I've been struggling to keep my grades at an acceptable level, and now my mom has taken away the only thing I have left: The Internet. I've been able to get past her filters, but I've been paranoid that she'll find out. There's more, but I honestly don't know where to even begin with the rest of it.",hey man i am in the same boat with you. Sophomore in high school and life is fucking hell. My parents have raised me to think that anything below an 85 is not reasonable so I'm terrified of going below it and I'm losing friends left and right and it sucks ass. BUT lately i have really learned i only a few friends to make me happy. Things do get better man i promise.
Is it okay to take two welbutrin? Can't find the time or motivation to see a doctor to up the milligram.. Can't remember what I'm taking right now but I'm starting to think I need more.,I would consult the doctor before doing anything because a certain amount of one medication can affect others.
Pros/cons of diagnosis. been taking anti-depressants/anti-anxiety meds for a little over two years now. They definitely help but never technically been diagnosed and I think would really like to find someone who could diagnose me. Any pros or cons of finding a diagnosis?,"I feel like a pro would be validation. When a psychiatrist told me that yes, I do have anxiety, it really helped me to feel like I wasn't just over reacting you know? Another pro would be future doctors that you see understanding your diagnoses. I can't really think of an con to be honest. It's also possible that whoever is prescribing your medication has diagnosed you already. I would ask!"
How do I know if I have clinical depression?. I just feel shitty all the time even though the reasons are tiny and petty,"Sometimes the reasons for having depression are irrelevant. If your gut instincts are telling you you may be depressed, then there could be some truth to it. At this stage you should be seeking treatments and seeing if you notice any differences in how you feel. I'd recommend running outdoors for 45 minutes at least 5 times a week. This is actually more powerful than antidepressant medication and without unhealthy side effects - on the contrary - it strengthens connections in the brain which are responsible for feeling good. Give this a try and see how you feel."
Been in bed all day today. I desperately wanted to mop my floors do my laundry and work out but. I just can't get myself out of this bed And off this dam phone.,"I get it. I got out of my bed, picked up my books (to study), my pc, but then just went to another bed I have at home. :/"

"Good vibes/prayer request? Starting treatments next week. I have tried everything, medication, exercise, DBT, yoga, changing my diet, and I'm about to start TMS treatments five times a week. I'm praying that this helps, I'm so tired of feeling like this.","Sending some good vibes and prayers your way! I hope you find the help you seek with your treatments and if this isn't what helps please don't ever stop looking. Exercise became my escape but it wasn't through cardio or weight training like I had done for years with zero progress towards self improvement, it came in the form of dancing. Best of luck and please feel free to DM me when you need to vent about anything!"
"Does anybody else close their eyes frequently?. Everyday, I find myself walking with my eyes closed to avoid physically seeing my loneliness. I personally don't know why, however knowing that I can avoid the world- even for only a second- is helpful.","People are invisible to me in the streets. They don't exist. I always walk like if there was nobody walking because I don't have so much attention to waste. I can make everyone vanish in my brain even if I'm walking inside a crowd. I tend to pretend I am walking inside a crowd of dolls or machines with sleepy consciousness/energy. I do it all the time because I need to think clearly and **focus**. Staring at moving people with different shapes, clothes and colors distract my focus and disrupt my peace of mind and suck my **energy**. But I like it when people direct their attention to me and stare at me because they subconsciously feed me with their energy and make me feel alive and they loose their vital energy in return which is **s**o sad. I need to stare at the horizon or the sky to focus and to give for the moment a **meaning** that the majority can not see because they are busy talking to others, staring at others, using their phones and giving their consent and **paying attention** and their **time** to others for nothing in return. They have no idea about the importance of these **moving** people and that they are in fact moving vital energies and one must focus to absorb those free energies of life. Movement in space creates time."
Feeling like killing myself right now.... I can't take it anymore. I am taking more than I should be taking. I hate everyone around me. Terrible at studies. No skills. No reason to be happy. I got nobody.....,"Hey man, go outside. Take a walk to somewhere neat around where you live. Get some fresh air and take some deep breaths. Embrace the beauty of nature for a few minutes and get that sense of peace. For those moments don't think of anything, just exist. It's surprisingly relieving."
"I almost got ran over today.. It's funny really, I wasn't scared. I wasn't anything. Just pissed off at the guy for blaming me.","What happened? &gt; I wasn't scared. I wasn't anything.

The only problem with death is that i wont be there to enjoy it... Yeah i just want to feel serennity and peace.,"You know that feeling when you wake up in the morning and realise that you don't have to get up for another hour, so you go back to sleep? That's how I imagine death to feel. Just a peaceful slipping away. No pain, no fear. Just peace and rest. I'm almost ready for it to be honest."
"Feeling guilty about living. I feel guilty whenever my parents fight each other, like it's my fault for being born; I feel as if I've given them nothing but trouble from the beginning.

Why don't you just try. Fuck you I've been trying to try my whole life,"the first person i opened up to was a girl i thought i was close friends with, but i was also a little bit in love with. what a mistake i know this sounds dumb, but like, i feel like your problems, you just have to get over them, i feel like it's all in your head fuck my ass man. people who haven't felt this, or just don't have the self awareness to recognize it (cause god damn this girl had her low moments too but she clung so hard onto the idea that she was fine. she's not) can really say some hurtful things."

"Just losing all hope in life and people.. Everything seems to be going wrong. politics, environment and my faith in humanity. Nothing seems worth it","Ugh, you are absolutely right; the world and humans are a mess. This might not make you feel better but it has always been a mess. It actually isn't really much worse than it has always been. I read a certain amount of history and have come to realize this. Even if you just read the Old Testament you can see how crappy people were. One thing that helps me is to stay away from news. I don't think it makes us informed if all we know is the bad stuff. Also try subscribing and reading Uplifting News on a regular basis. Made Me Smile is also a good. Finally to really get informed about the good stuff going on in the world, volunteer. I prefer Habitate for Humanity; you meet people from all walks of life doing what little they can to help others. This doesn't make the news very often but is happening everyday."
"Looking for advice. I have been in a recently. I been to work in 2 weeks and have just been extremely depressed &amp; anxious. I am basically sick of this and ready to make a change but I know where to start. I have major issues opening up to a therapist and have tried numerous times and constantly fail. I am taking meds for the depression and anxiety, but basically think what taking is enough. Does anyone have advice on different coping tactics you use throughout the day to get yourself past the extreme feelings of anxiety? Any other advice on positive or motivational changes I could consider? Willing to try basically anything at this point...","I feel pretty anxious myself. But when i have no choice I just come to the point where i think what's the worse that could happen? maybe I faint. But then there are people to help me. If I panic I can just excuse myself and leave. If the situation gets to much, I can leave anytime. And just knowing that I am always in controll of what I am doing helps me a lot. Having trouble in the subway? Well, you can pull the breaks anytime. That's pretty expensive and affects a lot of people but just knowing that I could is a big plus. I am not a prisoner in these situations. I am free. I can leave whenever I want. But sometimes I realize I panic because of no logical reason. I tell that myself. Than I make a breathing exercise and it calms down. My therapist told me, when you have the feeling of not getting enough air breath through a straw. It calms you down, makes you hear your breath and you start focussing on it. &amp;#x200B; I hope that helped &amp;#x200B;"

How do I stop overthinking things?. Essentially what the title says. Reason why I ask is because I feel it contributes to my numbness.,What is it that you're overthinking?
Has medical marijuana worked for other peoples depression?. I'm just curious about peoples ideas on the matter.,"It helped at the beginning of my marijuana usage when I was smoking maybe 2-3 times a week but if it can spiral out of control pretty quickly to where it creates a vicious cycle of abuse. The marijuana also blew my anxiety through the roof. In my experience, the depression will come back once not high (and sometimes even worse than it was before getting high) which has the potential for psychological dependence. Within 9 months of beginning self medication I went from smoking like $10 worth 2-3 times a week to 2-3 times a day so beware. By the end of the 9 month period I was spending about $200 a week on weed. Would possibly recommend but i think the best idea for those with addictive/binging personalities because you could end up seriously abusing it during massive depressive episodes."
Forget them. Don't you wish you could forget them the same way they forgot you?,The mind replays what the heart can't delete.
I want to die. Title says it all. But i want to not live my life. Its hard to see past today and the right now emotions.,"I have that problem too. Some things my CBT therapist suggested were: cold cloth on face, smelling lavender, taking a brisk walk, breathing exercises, and watching something funny. I truly hope you escape that dark cloud. I can confirm that I'm glad I lived to do and have the things I've done, despite pits of gravityless depression, despair and cutting. I believe you will find your way to good things as well."
How can you fake happiness when you feel so low?. I can't even manage a fake smile at the moment.,"it's so taxing after awhile. i think sometimes it's fine, the pretending, and maybe will even trick me for a brief moment. but over time it's just so exhausting to keep up."

"I'm so dead I find my own depression humorous. I usually come out of these gross episodes where I don't move, or bathe, or really do anything whatsoever, pretty quickly.

Do you have a loving friend to reach out to? Do you have a pet you may be able to hang out with? A faith group that brings you peace? What's one thing you could do right now that would feel like a healthy step and would bring you some positive vibes.
I'm so done with life. I'm really tempted to just end it right now,"Don't do it.

Through word of mouth, I started working for this nice couple. They new nothing about my mental illness and made me feel so comfortable, I told them. They have been unbelievably supportive. They've adopted me as their grandson and continuously check to see how I'm doing and to take me to breakfast or lunch. I'll even be going to Canada with them in a few months.

How do I deal with study burnout?. These days I just can't seem to concentrate on my studies or even do my assignments. I just have no motivation to do so. I'm slowly getting tired of this routine of endless studying. What should I do to get out of this burnout?,"Maybe you could break the routine somehow, like change your study space? Go to a cafe or the library or stay in your dorm (if you're in college)? That's what I tried to do when I was in a studying slump. I went to a cafe instead and it helped a little bit. You could even treat yourself to something there. That definitely relaxed me. As for a means for motivation, if my depressive symptoms didn't completely take over, what used to drive me during hard times was my end goal, the career I was aiming for. Hope this helps!!"
"I feel like my mood swings exaust my family more than my suicide would. I'd hate to have a daughter/sister like me. My mood is unpredictable, it can change in a matter of a week, couple of days..I don't know what to do about it, I see how hard it is for my parents to guess if today I'm okay or not, to try lift up my mood, to worry and ask constantly. I think if I'd just die then it will be a clear answer and my family wouldn't have to worry anymore","Maybe it would exhaust them more over time. But the thing is that if you were to kill your self they would feel unimaginable pain and guilt. They may learn to cope with the pain but they will find ways to blame it on themselves. They will think it because they did or do something and it will haunt them for life. Talk with your family, work through it together, accept their love and try to understand why they say and do certain things from their point of view so you can understand their love for you. It will most likely be tough at first but it will make things easier."
"I just feel like ending everything. I'm the biggest disappointment ever to everyone , my parents , teachers , friends .friends ? I don't think they think about me as someone like that . I'm just afraid to kill myself . I'll probably find motivation soon enough to end my life.",What have you tried in order to combat depression?
I want to kill myself but I don't want to ruin Christmas. But I don't want to live to see January either.,How did the run go?

Break even.. Do you think my partner whom broke up with me because of depression is feeling as hurt as I am right now? My former partner seems to be doing very well.,"Because of your depression or your partners?  My ex broke up with me because of hers. At the time she said she still loved me but needed to get better (really true, she was a nutcase). We recently talked after a few months of NC and her getting leveled out on anti-depressants. Her hurt was not the same as mine. Her emotions were flat-lined. Anhedonia. The sadness, anger, frustration, confusion, despair that I felt are emotions she was incapable of feeling. I know this because I was severely depressed myself years ago. Even now since she is on SSRI's, and with it being months later, I don't think her hurt is even close to what mine was. I think her hurt is more in regret. I honestly doubt she will ever truly hurt over this breakup - by the time she's off the meds and capable of feeling those raw emotions again, it will probably be a total of 1-2 years since the breakup. She'll only have to deal with regret - if even that.  Of course some cynical side of me wants her to feel what I did. I want her to grieve the loss of our relationship like I did. I want her to think about what we had, let those good memories fill her with the positive emotions we had together, and have them followed up by sadness over the realization she lost it. But when I really think about it, I know I don't want that to happen. She cried enough when she started sinking lower into depression. The outbursts, the frustration, the fear of losing me. I remember how much that happened. She hurt too, it just happened for months before the breakup, where mine was after."
"What music do you listen to when you are feeling down?. For me, I listen to a band called Counterparts and Hotel Books.","New Order, Elliott Smith, Joy Division"
i’m done. life is hard. i got rejected today. adopted and not even supposed to be alive. done. i give up. meds and counselors help.,I'm sorry to hear that. How long have you been dealing with depression? Life is indeed very messy and hard. I'd hang out with you and buy you a drink and listen to your story if I could.
"Honestly, if being around other people doesn't make me less lonely, how the heck am I ever supposed to *not* be lonely?. I'm just frustrated about this. I feel lonely and disconnected from other people even when I'm actively engaged in conversation or activities with them...I feel like I just lack some fundamental skill that others have to connect. Can you guys relate?","Yes. I find maintaining friendships is so exhausting, and I can barely manage the other stuff in my life as is. I know that when I disappear for a bit because it's all too much, no one will be there when I come back. I also feel like I don't really have much in common with the people I talk to. They're all so motivated and seem to maintain social lives so effortlessly. They talk about their weekends at clubs and hanging out and I think of how I spent my weekend playing video games for 10 hours instead of doing papers and it makes me feel completely isolated."
I feel like I'm too mentally ill to be loved. I just feel like if someone ever wanted me they'd walk away from me because of my anxiety and depression. I feel like I'd scare them off and they'd be incapable of loving me.,"your illness does not make you any less deserving of love, nor any harder to love. can it make you harder to deal with? yes. and not everyone will be able to deal with it, and you can never ask anyone to. but someone who cannot deal with it is not right for you. i am one of the people who choose to deal with it, my bf is severely depressed and has anxiety. i don't love him any less for it, he was already suffering from it when i met him and i still saw right through it, saw who he was. (kind and excitable and loving) when you're suffering, first and foremost what you need is to get better. being loved, by family or friends or a partner, is part of that. having a partner is not essential, though. i can talk about this for hours if you want me to, but it's important for any relationship you have to be healthy and not turn toxic. you are not a burden, you are not unlovable. at this point in your life people who you have close relations with have to be able to understand and support you. and you deserve that, and those people exist. it can be hard to imagine, when people are depressed their life is usually not in a state where they're very connected to like-minded people. but anything can happen, and things can change. and even without change, you can encounter great things. i can tell you about my experience if you ever want."
"I'm going to kill myself. Not today, but someday.... I feel like I'm headed in that direction","Just because you feel like you're headed in that direction, doesn't mean you actually are...and if you are, you can always turn the car around. You're the only one who controls the ride and where it goes. I've had many days (and I still have those days) where I've lost hope in life. Feel like there is no point to go on because no matter how much I try to get things on track, I fail. That no one cares about me, and if I were gone the whole world would have one less body to deal with. But, then I realize that these things are not permanent or untrue, and If i am not happy, I can change it...but, you can not change suicide. Try to take a step back and think about what brings you joy in your life currently, and think of the things you've enjoyed while growing up, and surround yourself with them. Try something new that you've always wished you'd try. These are all steps to a better life, one that's happier...and is definitely possible to achieve. It takes some time and work, but in the end it is worth it. Don't give up, the best things in life are always the ones that make you work the hardest for. Feeling like this, is not permanent, it's only temporary. You have many people who care for you, who I am quite certain will notice if you're gone, and would be devastated... not to mention the hundreds of other people you're robbing from the chance of getting to meet someone as amazing as you, too! Stay strong, and remember that it will always be okay. Life is what you make it."
"Want to die but don't want to kill myself. Given a chance to die, i will gladly accept it. Hit by a car, heart attack, sleep and won't wake up again, or any accident.","The only thing making me hesitant is my family. Seven siblings, four of them younger than me, and nothing scares me more than one of the little kids having to go through something that can leave them traumatized. On top of that, money is a big problem right now and I don't want my parents to have to deal with the costs. I feel so freaking stuck."
How the hell do i tell my parents i have a social phobia. Its honestly the hardest thing in the world,"There's no better person to tell someone something than a nurturing mother. They typically love you unconditionally. Friends and significant others get a scent of the depression on you and they distance themselves as it becomes a deeper problem as opposed to helping. If your mother loves you, she will understand.. And it's not like you are admitting you have gay sex or addictions to banging drugs up your arm or killed someone... This is (not to be insensitive) remotely benign to say to your family.. They might be able to recommend something that helps.."
"I know I need to get professional help now, but I am scared to. I don't want to admit to myself or anyone matter of fact that I've been depressed for so long.. I just want to be happy.",Are you feeling that you would be judged? Judging yourself? You should not be ashamed for taking actions that might help you be happier.
Sleeping in the bathtub. Moved my pillow and cover into the tub tonight. Because it's just one of those days. I'm so depressed that I want to die. And sleeping in a freaking tub somehow makes me feel better.,You do whatever you need to do.

What can i do when i feel the sadness or unmotivation set in help plz","do you have any hobbies? do you like movies, tv shows, books, music, games? they all seem to help me distract myself from feeling like shit, distraction is your friend when you hit an especially low spot."
"My mom just literally told me to man up, stop pitying myself and get a girlfriend. Thanks mom, I'm cured mom.",Pretty much lol. In my experience man up means to just ignore any and all emotional issues and act like life is fine. Shit's stupid.
Don't know why I can't kill myself. it's like some foreign force stops me every time,I know how you feel. Iv watched a short film about a guy with depression that can't kill himself. So he hires somebody to do it. It's a actually a really good short film. Look it up on YouTube . It's called Mr.Happy by Vice.
Does anyone else just drive around aimlessly for hours.. I stop pretty frequently because gas though.,"too poor to buy a car, so instead i walk aimlessly at my neighborhood"
Screw life.. Kinda depressed for no reason,"I hope it gets better for you. Just remember to take care of yourself while you are depressed. What do you tell people to do when they are sick with the flu? You tell them to drink water, get plenty of rest, don't overexert, and eat bland foods. Drink tea, medicine, whatever. This is recommended for the most rapid recovery. If they neglect this advice, they run the risk of getting sicker. What do you tell someone who is sick with depression? Just do your best to keep up with life. Make sure you eat, make sure you sleep, brush your teeth, do whatever chores you would normally do, try not to turn to any vice or addiction, and avoid isolating yourself. If you upkeep with life, you are more likely to see a faster recovery. If you fail to upkeep, you run the risk of digging a hole and becoming more depressed. You are strong, and you got this. Best of luck to you."
"How can i kill myself. i can handle this shit anymore, I'm already dead on the inside, i just want to end it.","Honestly, I don't know as I've never been suicidal myself. Still, if you want to talk, may I ask you if something happened to make you feel this way?"

Is there something going on in your life bud?
"Blasé Depression. This is something I've been thinking of, I dont actively try to kill myself but if it happened I wouldnt care. Im bored and sad with life and just want to die. I'm just about it all.","Similar for me. I fell like depression makes you care less about yourself. I remember once walking the streets and jaywalking at every corner. I was like, so what if I get hit by a car, worst case scenario I die, it's not as if that matters. I wasn't actively trying to get myself killed, just ignored my surroundings and my own safety. Fortunately I snapped out of it at some point, or I might not be here anymore."
"What does it take?. When you are in a rut, or have been depressed for a bit what can you do that helps?","I have to kickstart my ass into getting out of the house. Go to a museum, arboretum, take a walk somewhere. Once I get going, it's okay for a few hours. But that only works when I don't wake up and start drinking. Sometimes when I come back home it's the same old despair all over again."
I need to stop hiding from life. I'm sure you can tell that I'm not okay. I can't keep going on this way. I need to change how I'm living 'Cause isolation's unforgiving.

Unemployment. Do you get depressed without a job? What do you do during a day if not at work?,"&gt;Do you get depressed without a job? Yeah.I feel useless and like a burden for my family.What good I am for if I can't keep a simple job in a chocolate factory? &gt;What do you do during a day if not at work? Read self improvement articles,watch porn and masturbate,and clean my house. My advice for you you find yourself jobless is: # Do not waste your time. Do not lock yourself in your room and watch porn&amp;masturbate all long.Find something useful to do with your free time.Recharge your batteries.Start working out,you don't need to go to gym,just take a run in the morning and one in the evening.Build your emotional resilience.I do this by reading about it first (I am in the process of finding out what it means and then I have to apply it).A good start is r/Stoicism.Make yourself useful - clean your house and take care of your pets. After that start looking for another job and do not despair."
"I Don’t Want to Hang Out with Anyone. just come back from school, and I really feel like hanging out with anyone because I feel as though no one wants to spend time with me, and I feel like if I ask, they do it out of pity...was curious if anyone felt the same way","I also struggle with this...whenever I hang out with people, I feel like they can do so much better than me and I wonder why they bother hanging out with me.

I'm putting no effort into my future because I don't think I'll have one,"All these posts, I swear we're a hive mind, or we're the same person same soul in different bodies."
I need to know. Has anyone actually got better?. starting to feel like the idea of recovery is just a myth to keep me from committing suicide. tried every medication and nothing has helped. If no chance of getting better the point of going on?,"I'm not 'cured' but I'm a thousand times better than I used to be, there's a light at the end of the tunnel. The key has been little steps over a long time, unfortunately there are no quick fixes. Keep going, keep experimenting with treatments, there's one out there that'll work for you. You can do this!"
I hate this world and I hate work and I’m unable to sustain myself. I’m awkward boring and weird so everyone treats me like shit and I tried to fix this for 18 years but no result it’s staying.

Figure yourself out. nobody so broken that it cannot be fixed.
"College graduates/current college students:. How have you gotten through difficult parts of your school year when your depression is severely effecting your academic work? Going through a difficult path this semester and tanked two exams this week already, really looking for some advice to improve.","Yes, I have. Currently I am a mess. Nevertheless there used to be a time when I was a mess, but still had a reason to pick myself up and get my shit done. If you want to study and pass your exams, this is what I did: - Get busy studying now (within 15 minutes). No excuses to eat/drink a bit. Not going to the bathroom. Just study. Phone away. If possible laptop/computer away. Do this for at least one hour and take a small break to get fresh air if you want and drink some water. NO PHONE. Then back to studying. Again one hour or more. - After studying go for a run (I don't care if it is 11 pm) or exercise in some other way. - Eat healthy. You crave good tasting food? chocolate? chips? No go. When you go to the supermarket, fast food is not an option. You will not spend your money on that shit. No chips, no sweet stuff, no special drinks. Fruit/vegetables/carbs/meat/fish/bread/milk/yoghurt. Healthy stuff. Lots of water. - Go to bed on time. Get out of bed on time. - No thinking! Only actions. - Do one thing at a time. No thinking about tomorrow or the next hours. Just about the next minute. What are you going to do now? Shower? check. Dress? check. Breakfast? check. Go to library? check. Study one hour? check. Have a small break and drink water? check. continue. - If possible, study with other people - (added) When I get stuck, it has been VERY helpful for me to discuss this with other students. This has been very difficult for me, because I have a crazy amount of pride and am very ashamed of showing I do not understand something. Nonetheless, it has helped me so much to just discuss a problem where i got stuck with someone and then see the light which enables me to continue studying (instead of procrastinating till everything went to shit). This doesn't solve the deeper problems, but it probably will get you through your exams as good as possible. At least, this is how I managed to finish my undergraduate years. Not healthy, but it worked. Also you will probably find that by being so hard for yourself, setting boundaries and actually following them, you will start to feel a lot better about yourself and gain confidence. This is a trap, do not get satisfied with yourself. Being satisfied and giving yourself more space to slightly cross your boundaries again is equal to getting on the slide that will get you right back into the pit. This became a rant, hope it helps you in some way."
"If this is what life is, I don't want to experience any more of it. Things just get worse, not better.","Maybe one day. as you dream, things will get better. Hopefully. but mostly i believe you are the only one who can make things better. If you are feeling like talking. I'm here. &lt;3. :)"

I'm so depressed my head hurts, my eyes feel like they're about to explode and I feel like I can't breathe properly. Any tips on how to get through this?","I self harm, but Its not something I would ever suggest. It helps at first but eventually you just have two problems instead of one. I try to rest more and drink lots of water, that seems to help. If you can, try to see a doctor. Depression can be a symptom of something else, especially with those other symptoms."
If you managed to turn around and leave your depression behind...how did you do it?. I'm just giving up...been taking Prozac for 2 months and no change whatsoever. All I can think about is buying some razors and just get it over with.,I know. I sadly do not have a good answer. as clueless as you are.
I know I won't do it but... I've been thinking about downing all of my lorazepam. Ive been searching painless ways to kill yourself. But my lorazepam keeps beckoning me. Im afraid it will fail and I may end up with severe brain issues. I have about 90 pills. 1 mg each.,It won't kill you...if you need someone to talk to reach out to me. I go through the same shit
How do you kill hope?. I don't care for hope. How does one get rid of hope.,"Hope is good, if it is the type of hope that fuels passion. For me, I haven't had much hope/dream that has led to creativity for quite a long time. There is another type of hope, one which doesn't really do anything. Its a little nagging voice saying 'hey, things will get better', even in a shitty situation. Some people like this guy, because he provides a brief moment of contentment in a horrible clashing world. Others don't like him, because they see that after a while, his prophecies don't really come true. I don't know what to do with my hope. I'm having 95% the second type and not much of the first."
Anybody else staying in bed all day?. Seems like everybody else is enjoying the holiday but to me it's the same as any other day. I wasn't invited to any cookouts and I don't have any friends to go see fireworks with so I guess I will just stay in bed.,"Yeah, I wasn't invited to anything either. My family invited me to sit alone and watch all their dogs while they kayak, but I figured it would be less depressing here. I honestly wish I could've worked today."

Cut for the first time in 3 years. I believe I went so long without it. It brought me such instant relief.,this year after a year no incident. it felt so familiar and delicious in a way only those had the habit will know. but its not a good habit. its just not healthy to have open wounds constantly and cutting yourself to handle problems wont help you deal with whats upsetting you. it instead will be a permanent reminder of the pain you feel now. what if instead you used the energy to do something constructive. express yourself. do whatever you Need to do. you Want to cut. you dont need to. you never have. it was just a coping mechanism. you lived without it before and theres no good reason to do it. you dont need to do this. youre not weak or damaged for losing to your emotions and giving into yourself now. but dont lose yourself in the idea that you have to throw all the progress you made away. its been three years and cut yourself once in all those three. thats something to be proud of. sorry this is kinda long but i personally cut for the first time at 11 and it become a habit til 13. i had a relapse myself earlier this year and i know the urge may never go away completely but its something you can control. you can gain greater satisfaction doing something that fulfills you rather than damages you. its just a fact.

I often think about the person I would have been without depression.. So many hobbies and passions that I abandoned.,Me too. I think about this constantly and it gives me a lot of anxiety as well. I would have studied something different in school and actually have fun at my job. Sometimes I cry about it but what can you do...
Anti-depressants and love/emotions. What's it like for you?,My meds (been on at least 12 different ones over the years) never changed my emotions but usually made me feel that I had the right to feel them and that I could manage them. Like I would feel anxious and sad but my brain had the capability to say yes this sucks but we are moving past it and can fix it or forget it. With depression I can't do that..it just consumes me

"Do you guys ever feel like you’re having a blank mind or something?. Like everyday, I am not myself at all. I know though, I think depression. Can anyone relate though?",Sounds very similar to myself. Depression is a common part of my life but even when I'm not going through a cycle I still suffer from this blank mind where I simply can't organize a thought or put anything into words. I've come to a realization that it may be a form of anxiety. For me it can feel like an internal panic attack. I wish I could offer you some words of wisdom but I'm just know starting my battle to overcome it.

Just continue to comfort him and know you've done everything you can to help."
"is there any point in trying to improve. i am fat and lonely, and when i picture myself thin and having friends i still feel empty. is there any point?","Definitely. I know it may not seem like it ,but it's nice when once in a while somebody asks you if you want to go out or have a drink. Besides what do you have to loose ? I've been lonely too but once I started at least trying to socialize I felt much better. I met one of my best friends at a driving school. The only reason we spoke that day is because I said to him ,,That's a cool watch ,what brand is that ?,,. The point I'm trying to make is that you can meet your future wife in the most unlikely of places and all you have to do is ask ,,How you doing ?,,."

Edit:I am an Outcast with no friends &amp; depressed,"Photography, definitely. It will get you out in the world and expose you to so much in your pursuit of beauty and aesthetic. I don't know what you mean by make edits, so I can't really recommend that. Drawing might also be fulfilling for you, especially on rainy days when you don't want to go out with the camera. Although be warned, it can be extremely frustrating when you can't just translate your mind to the paper and are stuck building rudimentary skills."
pain with hanging yourself. i always thought hanging yourself would be extremely painful. however i just choked myself with my belt because i was curious. it wasnt really painful and i started to black out quickly. still figuring out when. where and how ill go though. this give me some reassurence though :),There is a difference between choking yourself with the belt and dangling your bodyweight from a rope. It will hurt.
"I'm Fucking tired. I'm done, done with everything. I'm done pretending everything thing is ok. I'm done not understanding why I feel the way I Fucking feel. I'm done fighting. It's only a matter of time until I just end it.","It's useless commiting suicide. I mean, you're gonna lose anyway. Why not trying?"
"Finally got prescribed meds by a really nice psychiatrist. Now I'm anxious about taking them. I was really excited but now that it's time to, I'm worried... I want to but feel like I shouldn't?",Why do you feel like that? There's no shame in taking something that will improve your quality of life.
Is there anything worse than loneliness?. Loneliness is like a terminal illness. It's killing me. This is why I'm depressed. It hurts so much. And all I can do is snore it until I die and don't have to think about it anymore.,Dont be mad because of this following one: YOU are responsible for it. You know that girl/guy who is cool to everyone? Is it hard to be cool like him/hear?
I wish the things I said and wrote didn't sound so cringe.. I use to some what have creativity. Now its all practically gone. I can sit there for hours but nothing ever comes.,"The feelings now are coming out in the most bare form possible, there's nothing poetic anymore, I feel the need to get them out as soon as possible. There is no time to make it sound beautiful."
"I’m in constant pain, my chest hurts and I feel like I’m going to have an actual heart attack. awful to feel this way every second. I really understand the meaning of heartache. Like when people compare that to the feeling of being stabbed in the heart not kidding. I want this terrible pain to end. Crying every single night for the past two weeks.",Why u feeling like this?? the cause
"I kiss and hug my pillow and blanket in the morning because I have never had a girlfriend. Depressed people deserve love, too.","Well, how i see it right now, you have 3 options 1- Buy or adopt a pet. They will love you, no matter what, if you love them too. You won't feel alone. They will be there at all times for you, and you for them. Who knows, they even migth help you find a partner! 2- Go and meet new people. I know its hard, but if you want to find love, do it. Get to know people. Talk to them, be their friends. If you have any party or any event, go. You will eventually find someone that likes you, and you like her. Also, don't look for sex. You will never fuck on the first date, and sex is not the only thing that matters in life. Would you fuck a doll with no feelings? Always talk with girls with the mentality that you won't have sex with them. Gurls also feel love. 3- Keep living with your pillow. If you don't have the motivation or will to do the 2 things i mentioned earlier, remember that atleast you will have a pillow that loves you, and a anonymousor that cares about you."
"Does Light Help?. I was thinking of buying a U.V bulb because I always feel more depressed in the winter, and I was wondering if there were any bulbs that work with normal lamps, and if it would actually help.","This is known as SAD or Seasonal Affective Disorder, or something like that. And yeah a bulb and natural lighting help out a lot"
When things keep getting worse...after you've tried everything.... Doom. Absolute doom. I'm fucked.,"Yes right. So my rational mind would tell me right now dealing with something but as experience has showed me I will be better once through it. So the practical thing for me to do would be to relax and be aware of my tendencies to fall victim to my emotions which in turn produce thoughts that are self destructive and wasting my time. See to be emotional is irrationality and far from practical. Take some time out and just breathe and let the shit go...you got this. you are right now...literally and I want to fall into those emotions and spread the way I feel everywhere. I want those who love me to know and those who hate me to know more but in the f u kinda way. But we because we have been here before and got through it-and we were happy again-and bam we are here now. But we will be happy again. You know what would make me happy right buffalo wings lol...like for real. That is the break through-realizing that it fucking sucks sometimes. So what, supposed too...because that is what makes buffalo wings sooo much better hahahaha. I hope you feel better all I wish for you!!!"
"Is it normal to want to die out of boredom / apathy?. Whenever I think about suicide (which is a lot) I always think of the lead up to it being yep, I'm fucking done with this, peace out bye. and not everything in life is shit and there's no other way out than this","I am not sure it is 'normal', whatever that is.... I have definitely felt this a lot in the last 4 years. I find my interest in life and everything else comes and goes, and when it goes I think 'what the hell is the point of all of this?'"
Idk why I was so eager to get back to college.. Been here a day and I already know I won't be able to do this shit for another year.,I literally took a year off last year because I just couldn't cope at all. I'll be going back in a fortnight and I already know that I won't be able to get out of bed again. I really wonder what's the point sometimes.
I feel like i have just wasted 20 years of my life.. Happy birthday to me i guess...,"It's your birthday? Well, happy birthday... And I can relate. I'm pushing 30 and I feel like I have wasted what were supposed to be the best years of my life..."
Posting this here because I have nowhere else to put it where anyone will give a shit..going to finally put a bullet through my useless fucking skull.. I can't do this anymore. I promised myself I would give myself last night to sleep it off and feel better in the morning. I don't feel better. I feel a thousand times worse. I'm sick. I'm tired. I'm not going to do this anymore.,Hey uh do you want to talk it through PMs? I feel like having a convo would help you a bit.
The smallest things really bring me down.. I know not the end of the world but why does it feel like it is? And if it feels like the end of the world why it actually end?,"Sometimes, when something happens in the moment, we see it as this huge thing because it is the center of our focus. It is only once those moments pass that we can look back and connect the dots to see that it really wasn't such a big deal. So my advice is this: As you look forward, remember that in the past the dots have always connected correctly, and have faith that those dots will connect the way they need to again. People often ask me why I don't worry about these seemingly huge problems in my life. Well, it's not that I don't worry, because I do. That's just being human, but I constantly remind myself that things usually just work out, and I just need to run the course that I see in front of me. So follow the course, stay on track, and when little problems feel like mountains in front of you, have faith that the dots will connect, and you will come out the other side as a stronger person. Good luck, my friend."
"I feel like no matter how happy or how good a situation is, in the back of my head I can’t feel happy.. After a while I recede back into my depressive shell and I honestly wish I could escape from it. And yet the only thing I feel that could stop me from feeling this way was if I was in a grave.",LOL I feel like this every fucking day. No matter how good the situation is I always know that not shit and ever be to myself or anybody and happiness is only temporary. definitely not alone.
My life means nothing. I'm going to kill myself soon.,"I can't possibly step inside your mind right now and know the right thing to say, but I'm just here to say that being alive is the most, only meaningful thing in the universe. The Stars wouldn't be beautiful or bright if there were no eyes to see them. The universe is so big it is easy to feel like a speck, but there is a universe *inside* you as well and you have the power to create one, you are so much more than a speck, you are a light that's the only metaphor I can think of but it doesn't quite capture it"
I just want it to end.. a piece of shit that ruins every holiday. I hope I die soon. I deserve it.,"I feel ruined my birthday, my daughters, my fathers birthday, and now Christmas. your track record for this year? I fucking hate it. such a god damn asshole ruining every holiday. But I ever get better it seems."
Anybody else just thinking of entering self-imposed exile?. I really fucking hate society and how it shoves its standards down my throat.,Where does self exile exist as I never found it
"If I have a power that I can let people feel my pain, They would finally understand what it’s like.. This just popped up in my mind, If that happened. They can finally understand what I feel.",Why would you want them to?
"even when i actually do feel ok for a day, i feel like i'm so used to feeling like shit that i feel like i need to feel pathetic to feel normal. and then that thought like, why do i not feel down right now. why aren't you feeling down, just keeps bothering me. anyone relate?","Yes, you are not alone. Do you feel guilt or shame - what I mean by that is do you feel like you don't deserve that 1 day of feeling OK? It feels so easy to slip back because it's comfortable, right? It's familiar and easy. Kudos to you for being able to have good days! YOU SHOULD BE EXCITED! Keep enjoying those good days and there will begin to be more and more."
"I hate it when my depression lifts just enough for me to be able to try to work on my studies, but not enough to make it easy to stay focused, motivated and productive.. At least when I'm completely hopeless, bordeline suicidal and that I sleep 16 hours/day I just CAN'T work. I feel even more like a lazy failure when I know that I could work but that it would be reaaaaally hard because I just have no motivation, and trouble concentrating.","I feel you, I'm in the same situation. My depression and anxiety is just good enough for me to be in uni or work, but never good enough for me to keep the job or do good in school."
"Any painless methods of suicide?. Just wondering in case I feel even worse than I already am about me, my life and I? Plus my mind","No. The people who love you will feel some measure of pain for the rest of their lives. I know that wasn't the kind of pain you were asking about, but yeah, there's always going to be pain for someone I'm afraid."
"I just wish that I was good enough. I wish that I could be happy. I wish that I could be someone that people want to be around. I wish I could be someone that people want to message first. That people want to invite first to things. That people would be interested in. I know that I'm not good enough, but I'm trying so fucking hard to be. I keep working and working but I feel like it's too late. That everyone I care about are going to pass me by while I'm still working. I'm going to end up fucking alone. I'm going to die fucking alone.","Sometimes having friends isn't about them liking you, but rather that you like things that other people do. Like if you are really into something, say cars, than if you have a car and go to car meets or race, others will see this and know that you're the guy to know if they want to get into a car scene. Another example would be if you are really into books and people feel like reading something and know that you are into books, they might come to you for recommendations. Most friends bond over a subject before they ever get to know each other as anything more than people interested in the same thing."
"I'm 30 years old, and the RL conversations with girls I've had, I could count on one hand.. Literally. Even including my school years.",Im a woman and i know i get along better with men. Ones who arent trying to screw me and forget me anyway. Women in general like to talk talk talk. If thats all youre looking for (at least to start) most of them would chat with you.
"The key to a happy life is ignorance. The world is a bad place and if you tune out the news, your money issues, and the world issues, then you can live a happier life",That may be the case but seems like practicing stoicism is also option to have a supposed happy life I know about you but for me to realized that every little thing that I worry about is just so small to the rest of the world that I help myself but to chuckle I expect anything good to happen to me from now on and all these minor inconviences will eventually end at some point So why bother worrying about it?
What to expect from Prozac?. Basically title.. Just started on 20mg/day dose.,It did nothing for me me though l was misdiagnosed - l'm actually bipolar. I was on it for around two years in total. I remember that it had very few side effects.
Early signs of depression?. What are your experiences with early sign of depression?,"For me, I knew something was wrong when I had my first breakdown. I used to tell myself that I was tired or just lazy because I couldn't get things done. In actual fact, I had no motivation left in me. However, after that episode, it got worse for me because I felt all alone as I had no one to confide to, especially when my first breakdown was in front of my family."
Told my mom i want anti depressants she said no :(. Im like rlly fucked mentally rn,We may need to hear the content of the conversation. Just saying something like was seem very convincing. Perhaps think I should try antidepressants like to see a Dr for my depression and see if benefit from
I feel like I broke the record for suicidal thoughts.. I hate myself and I want to die.,"I'm sorry you're feeling like that. I know it sounds grim as fuck, but if you broke the record for suicidal thoughts? It also means you've broken the record for resisting suicidal thoughts, and that's something to be proud of - even if it doesn't feel like it just now"
"Birthday blues. I hate birthdays. No one remembers it. Not even my Usually just end up crying all day because I realize I mean nothing. My twin usually gets all the happy birthday wishes and cake. a nobody. Wish I could off myself, too wimpy to do that.",Your fiance is a bumface for not remembering. Get a new one. Happy birthday
"There's so much to do.... It's hard to force myself to do things. I just want everything to stop, if only for a brief eternity. I just want to stop and rest. Is that too much to ask?","Well, is moved into a new home a few months ago, befor that i always had to walk 30 - 60 minutes to get where ever i had to go (sschool, work, train station and so on). Everyone was always so confused why i liked to walk the whole way, even if someone would offer me to drive to work,s chool, or back home again. I just liked to put my headphones on, listen to music, and let my thoughts just flow. I HAD to go from A to B, so i wouldn't worry about something i still have to do, because i could do nothing while i had to walk from A to B. I could just disconnect from my life for a while. And it always felt great. Dont get me wrong, all the bad thoughts, the bad emotions and feelings weren't gone, but it was just different, in a beautiful way. It seems like sometimes we have to force our mind to get some rest in a way or another."
"Today I felt a lot better than I did in the past year, but now I feel dead again. Will you fucking fuck off depression?!","I know the feeling. It sucks. But maybe now when you had even short moment of relief, maybe even happiness, you know it's possible to feel that way and you can try to get energy from that. Hope it doesn't sound stupid. Stay strong."
if anti-depressants are so bad then what should one take?. Im passing through a huge crisis right now,"what are you needing help with? part of the problem with anti depressents is how easily and flippantly they are prescribed. There is use for these medications but should be far more proper professional analysis before determining the correct meds, and monitoring. Lack of health care support means throwing the most widely used ones at a patient, refer a psych and hope for the best. They are not terrible, can help in many people but take so long to be effective and are hit and miss so its a tough solution when in a present difficult crisis. Sometimes doctors will prescribe short term assistance like Benzos and tranquilizers to keep stable in the short term, I found this works better for me than long term anti-depressents."
"Have you found anything to help you sleep?. I'm tired all the time but I just can't sleep. I've tried zzzquil, melatonin, working out to tire me even more, and even a lavender spray by my bed but nothing works for me. Is there anything that has helped you?","Ambien, xanax, cough syrup, a handful of muscle relaxers. Drinking alcohol keeps me awake. Zzquil and melatonin do nothing for me."
Alone. I wanted to help you. I was worried. Stressed. Anxious. Always making sure you were okay. I felt like you needed me. I wanted to be there for you. But I guess you're better now and you don't need me anymore.,I hope that letting that out can put you at some peace.
"Yesterday my dog died, not sure how to move on.... Yesterday my dog passed away, i just feel empty as hell, not sure what to do, it's quiet without him, he was my best friend.","I'm so sorry you're going through this.. My dog passed away two months ago so I know how painful it is :( I adopted another dog, I was still upset but it definitely helped me with the grieving process."
"I'm a damn waste of life.. The more I think about it, the more I realize it's the truth. I am a failure and a dissapointment, I can't even make the right choice to commit suicide at which point I'll finally stop being a burden to everyone around me. Would've been better if I'd never been born in the first place, then I would never have become this waste of air and space and I would've never dissapointed my parents like I have. I guess all the years of absolute self hatred were right, I'm a worthless fuck up who should probably just end it all.","There must be something making you feeling this way mate, you just gotta identify it."
im depressed. can someone lift me up for a bit?,I can't make any promises :P But I'm up so I'll try to help. What's up?

I feel so empty.... and I don't know what to do...,"What would you like to do? Hugs, hope things become better for you soon! :)"
I wish I was dreaming. I wanna wake up from this horrible nightmare,"That is actually true. It is not going to be easy. Sometimes you will feel down, like not achieving anything. Sometimes you feel like you are in the road you want to be. But all up to you. You are not alone in this road. Everyone goes through same shit."
"You can't love someone until you love yourself.. I don't think it's as great of advice as people think it is. I'm not sure if I will ever love myself, so it looks like i'll be alone forever.","I hear this all the time but I don't really understand what it's getting at. I remember one context in which it made sense but that was a fantasy novel. The novel is Pillars of Creation, part of the Sword of Truth series. One of the characters belongs to a cult which believes that all people are evil, using this belief to justify many atrocious crimes. He tells a woman that he loves her but she rejects him, saying that he doesn't know what love is and that he doesn't even love himself. I felt that made sense because in his case, it would basically be a completely foreign concept."
I'm drowning.. I can't do this. I really can't do this.,I'm drowning too. Everyday. It easy to take shit for granted. I never thought my life would get worse. I thought I was invincible but life fucks you up in so many ways. You need to find some inspirational music and listen to it a lot. Maybe make a goal for something. I know it all seems futile but little things sometimes help. But I know how hard it can be. When you're caught under those dark deep waves. Surrounded by onlookers on their cruise. It's easy to say fuck it but you deserve to be happy.. I hope u can find something that helps you through this darkness.

Emotionally, physically and financially just in a black hole and only getting worse and I really have nothing, and the world looks like about to get really fucked up anyway. really considering just doing it already","Please call a crisis counselor ASAP. Call your own therapist if you have one, let their answering service know you are in severe crisis, or head to the nearest ER and tell them you are having a mental health crisis. There are other ways to deal with this besides suicide. I have been there. Things have gotten better. I do struggle with at least a few things every day but not the way I do during what I call a crisis. I'm actually in a small crisis state right now, which led me to this board and trying to do the things my therapist has given me to do in the past like up my seroquel and ativan and rest as much as possble for a few days."
I want to die. Please kill me.. I hate my life. I'm such a failure of a person. My life is hopeless. This world has nothing for me. I want to die. I need to die. Please someone or something please fucking kill me. Please. Please.,so sorry hurting so much. here.
I like alcohol.. It's temporarily numbing my depression. Nice trick,"When you start alternating the shops where you buy your booze in order to hide your problem from the cashiers (not sure it's the right word, I'm French), you're pretty far gone."
Does anyone have a chronic physical condition and suffers from depression?. I do and I'm just morbidly curious as to know if there is anyone that feels their overarching condition physiologically or psychologically affects them.,I'm locked in a viscous cycle between my physical and mental illnesses. Been diagnosed with major depressive disorder for close to 5 years now. About 2 years ago I developed a movement disorder. It has been documented but not yet diagnosed as doctors haven't figured out anything about it. The depression triggers the non epileptic seizures which cause major disturbances in my life. Crippling my quality of life and reducing what I can do. This feeds into my depression. More negative mental health the worse and more frequent the seizure like symptoms happen. Also have bad tremors and ticks in relation to the non epileptic seizures. I often fall down and have issues walking and standing. Can barely leave my home. Am reduces to limit movement inside my home which has caused weight gain from decrease movements which also stregnthens my depression which in return causes more seizure like episodes. No medication helps my mental or physical health. It actually worsens both. I am going without treatment because doctors refuse to take it seriously or are completely dumbfounded. It has been over a year since anything was prescribed to attempt to help me. Seen several specialist. This terrible cycle has lead me to multiple suicide attempts in the last few months.
I'm so tired of faking a smile and saying I'm doing well. It gets so exhausting having to fake it whenever I'm forced to interact with people. I just wanna stay home and sleep most days.,"There are people, who want to know more if you don't fake it.. but some people are not worth knowing your secrets.. so just don't mind them, smile and move on. However, it can become stressful if you have nobody to talk to in a realistic way as possible without anything fake at all on you. With people, where you can toss that mask away for a moment and just be that negative little cunt for a moment lol.. we all need it sometimes."
"College really is hell if you have depression.... Seeing all these young, happy people enjoying their freedom, adulthood, youth, having relationships, etc. while I'm wondering if cutting again will help me feel better.

I graduated with 3.8 out of 4.0 from engineering college, I worked very hard after that nobody want to hire me.College is shit. now I stay home 24/7 literally nothing to do. I live with my parents, 23 years old. I want to die now. I am crying all the time, I don't know why I am here.Live is suck"
Suicide is the only way to end everything. I want to help myself anymore,I use to be miserable. I hated my wife. My life. Lots of stuff. But one day I just Decided to be happy. I got up. Told by bitch wife I loved her. Kissed her. Got up and sang in the shower. But i was miserable again in an hour. But then the next day i tried again. And the next afternoon. Again and again. Finally my wife wasnt a bitch anymore. My life wasnt so bad. I realized being miserable can be a choice. Our emotions can be changed by our actions. Wake up and just pretend to be happy. Pretend you like your job. Fail and do it again.
I'm not okay and I'm not going to be okay.. I've never been okay before. It's all pointless.,"Sometimes, I feel like this is okay though. The not being okay. I think there's this expectation we all have just because everyone else and everything around us shows this picture perfect life that is normal. Also, I get to the opinion sometimes that when none of it matters, it's actually the most liberating, because then I am truly free of my worldly concerns. I don't know. Silver lining and framing and all that jazz. Best of luck, friend."
The number of times I say I hate myself in my head is uncontrollable. It kinda comes out on its own like I'm hungry,"For me, it's the number of times I say, I hate my life and I hate people."
"Is it fair to date someone while depressed?. If so, how do you tell them about it and at what stage?",Yes! Dating can get you out of depression. Not without medical attention though. I'd tell from the get go
"That painfull moment when you realize Fuck, I have a mental illness.. Always my ego was one of the things that helped me, it was crushed at that moment when I aknowledged that I was mentally ill, like fuck it, even my mind left me.",I went to counseling yesterday and the counselor confirmed it. All I could think when I walked out of her office was ...fuck. I'm mentally ill?. I thought I was just being me my whole life and I'm still in extreme disbelief.
"Any advice for someone trying to ween off of medication. Any ideas to make the process a little smoother and easy, of course it will never be seemless. I try to keep to my diet and exercising aswell as daily affirmations, vitamins and 20 minutes daily meditation","I know it's obvious but don't ween too quickly. I don't know your drug but from my experience, I was fine until I got too cocky and lowered my dose way too quickly. I got sick, anxious, depressed, I threw up a few times. It sucked so just stay safe."
I am like a seeker who doesn't know what he is seeking. Just bouncing and going insane,Same. And somehow I always trick myself into believing I'll find it some day. How fucking naive am i.
I'm just an attention seeker. No one should take me seriously.,Why do you crave this attention?
"Dammit. I thought I was getting better, now I'm just as bad, if not worse, than I was before. There are not words for this, and nobody understands my pain.",I'm sorry you feel this way. Is there anything in particular that's bothering you?
Waking up and thinking is it thursday or friday.. No wait maybe it's wednesday.... Then you remember that it's actually Sunday. -___-,Some days I go the whole day without even knowing what day it is. And fuck I hate weekends.
Hope. I still hope someday my life will 'magically' get better. Who am I kidding ?,"The most important thing in a person is will. Nothing happens to or for people without the will to MAKE things happen. So change things. Otherwise, you really can't complain about em."
Nostalgia is a very bad reminder of what my life used to be. I wish i could live my life from when I was born again.. I miss the days of my parents carrying me to bed. I miss the days where everday was a new adventure. :(,"The only part of your life you get to experience is the present, and you gotta set aside some of that experience for the future. The past will always be happier or sadder because you have to recreate it every time and it gets a bit more distorted every time."

"I feel so dysfunctional. Ever wish you could live in someone else's shoes for a day to observe how they function through everyday life?. I feel extremely dysfunctional. I barely have the energy to get through an 8 hour workday. I have no motivation to clean, to be productive, etc. How do other people do it? I've always wondered how other people live.","I'd say that they choose to endure it... It's just that they have a more hopeful insight, they can fully understand something good will happen from their work, and they can grasp that it's real. That's why I sometimes wonder if Depression is stunted cognition (maybe imagination), because if I could imagine the beauty that life has to offer I'm sure that no matter what got in my way I'd plow through. Why would neurotypicals work so hard if they couldn't in some way see the other side, feel it, almost experiencing it? I just think we're unable to do that."
"Why should I live as such a misery. Just die already, die. Honestly I'm so nihilistic and selfish that I don't even care about my family who loves me.

"Convince me to call a helpline. Feeling really down currently.. Sorry if this is the wrong place. The issues will pass but while they're ongoing, I'm really struggling.",If you're ever feeling really down and feel you have nobody to talk to always call a help line. Plus what even if calling does nothing it's first occupied you for some time so that you don't do anything else and secondly it's better then not even bothering to call at all. Please call a help line and trust me it's what you need to do right now.
"All I want for Christmas is to disappear.. If I'm forced into this ridiculous exercise of feeling unwanted, left out and unimportant, can't I just not be here? The holidays suck.","Yeah, I just feel like, I don't care at all. But I know people are missing me at home when I'm stuck here studying for my finals but honestly I like it here, alone. In fact, I've decided not to answer any phone calls from my family because I just want to vanish from their attention."
I’m sick of being depressed. I just want to be normal. I only feel normal when drunk,That's not the real you. It just feels more comfortable but it's not. I hope you can see that. Stay strong friend.
"I'm empty inside. Only void.. I don't feel any emotions anymore. Only sometimes anger and sadness but even then, I can't cry and I can't scream. I am incapable of forcing myself to cry. If I could, I would. A lot. Anybody else can relate?","Yeah man I can relate. Especially with the crying and screaming thing. I wonder what's stopping us from crying? And what's worse is I've even had friends comment on how I don't get upset easily or mad about certain things that are usually normal to be mad about. But how can I if I don't even feel like I'm a real human being, yah know? I wish we could escape the void inside ourselves."
Today is my birthday! And I feel good.. Yay! :) I am happy today!,"I'm so glad you're happy! It's nice to see happy people :) Also, happy birthday! Hopefully your day turns/turned out well!"
Poetry. I need to feel warm Not to feel alone I need to stop the harm And melt my heart of stone,I like poems (but the ones I write are bad). Do you have any more you want to share with the world?
anyone have st johns wort success coming from prescription meds?. I heard the german brands are more effective. Are there any success stories that people that deal with anxiety and depression using this here?,Good question I would like to know to
"I didnt bleed at all..?. I poked a knife into my skin and think I broke through the entire skin layer but no blood came out. It was an attempt to find the artery. Since no blood came, does that mean I got deep enough but just managed to avoid and veins capillaries etc?","Trust me, don't do it. I have a scar on my left arm where I cut really deep and it gives me anxiety from people seeing it and depresses my mood looking at it. Doesn't help that I'm in fucking GCSEs either, but anyway I'm rambling. I know you wanna see blood; that's how I was too. But just don't, for me."
"I wish someone would just kill me. I'm so fucking tired of life, I wanna fucking die so badly but I know I won't ever have the courage to kill myself. I just wish I would die in an accident or someone would just come along and put me out of my fucking misery.","I was thinking the same thing like a minute ago. It's kinda reassuring to know I won't have the courage to take my own life, but I'm scared at the thought of what if I'll find the courage? honestly."
"My depression is ruining my relationship with my boyfriend.. He's worried, very worried about me. And I've just become a huge burden on him. I'm afraid my shit is scaring him off and this terrifies me. He is the only thing that really keeps me going right now.","My ex used to feel like this, as did I (we both had problems) and the best we could do was talk and be completely honest on where we stood with things like this. I hope he doesn't leave just because he maybe feels overwhelmed. But I've been on both ends, and felt a burden as well, so you aren't alone on that. I really do hope things work out. If you ever need a PM buddy, I have a pretty free schedule and am always looking for more pen pals, and possibly more friends."
"I just flunked a test and am having thought of hurting myself. As the title says, I want to chug a bottle of ibuprofen, or hang myself with a belt. I know these are dumb, and air don't want to do it, but I feel like such a worthless waste who should off his useless self.",Test mean literllery nothing. in like 3 years you proballey wont even remember that test
Visiting hometown feeling sad as hell. Been here for a month now and i just feel empty i need help,Could you tell us more? visiting my hometown too and I kind of have an... uneasy feeling with it too. Feels like I achieved anything since I left home and is still the same weak and shy little guy. But at the same time I also grew estranged with my hometown and my friends and family over here. Idk if that even made any sense but hey have an internet hug buddy the least I could do
I'm pathetic. My life is pathetic and has no meaning.,"All meaning is made up. Maybe find solace in the fact you are just valuable/invaluable as anything else: Doves, cows, trees, minerals, other humans, stars. Try to see what about your life you hate so much, specifics, and try to change those things. PLay with things you are scared to do, do things that will make you feel better about yourself and your life, read positive mantras, read books that make your mental concept of the world expand. Force yourself onto new experiences. I think with time one's self loathing can be softened. After all the self loathing didnt come from you but from other's, from the environment. Babies dont hate themselves."
"I'm Close to having a breakdown in school Help.. Today, I've felt more hopelessly depressed than i have my whole life, and i just don't know if i can make it through the day. Please help, honesty i just want to die.  (to my fbi agent i don't plan on pulling a nick cruz)","Hey, what grade are you in? 29 and I have felt that way many many times especially when I was going through school. Negativity is temporary I promise you. Honestly high school is just a blip on the radar for you I swear. It feel like it now but damn are you going to feel good when you persevere. And you will persevere I promise you, I promise you that you can do it. If you need someone to talk to feel free to message me if you are comfortable. I grew up in a dirty and chaotic home with cat shit behind the couches and the TV and everything smelled bad,all the clothes smelled like mildew and my parents were upset and angry all the time and there were drugs involved and I was overweight and nobody was helping and yada yada yada and I just want you to know that no matter how bad it gets, you build a unique strength that no one else can even touch upon just by making it day by day. Your experience, is one that I understand I promise you and you are going to come out of this a bad ass. I promise you can do it"
"You have low self-esteem.. Yeah no shit. I mean, thank you, kind well-meaning person. I can assure you that my little 'problems' go beyond low self-esteem at this point.","I feel that way, but somehow I always manage to lose even more if someone insults me, so clearly I've got some buried somewhere. I wish I could just have no self-esteem, so that I could get that insult immunity, but nope, whenever I think I'm out I find more to lose."
Does anyone want to die but have no motivation to do it?. It can't be just me. Or maybe it is.,It's the last thing I'll do. But I have too much to do first.
"Cried again.. Crying, crying, crying. Can you fucking end it. Fuck, people, cared for me. And i'm still fucking alone.","I'm really sorry you're feeling this way. A person can be cared for by dozens and still feel alone, depression is a monster. I hope you're able to make progress against it in your own way, or by talking to people you trust, living the life you want to live, or by obtaining professional help. Please send me a message if you would like to talk to someone privately."
When you try to self-medicate but you don't get drunk. I just finished a whole bottle of wine and am only slightly tipsy. Feelsbadman,"I'm in the same boat, if I do get drunk it's not the fun kind it's more like all those depressing thoughts start boiling over. I don't drink liquor anymore for that reason, now I stick to a few beers every night and that's usually enough to help me relax."
Ugly af. Being a solid 3.5 and having a thing for 10s is tough,"Everybody has a thing for 10s tho, numeral ratings for people are dumb anyways. If you get to know people you can develop feelings for them not only based on physical appearance or even find out after all they're not that attractive in the end. Granted it plays a huge part initially and people who say otherwise are hypocrits but yeah it doesn't just stop there. But still, I am ugly and I hate myself haha"
Money. All I am worth is the money my employer makes off of me. What else can I do to enjoy life? Right now I feel like canon fodder for opportunistic baby boomers. Why continue?,"Only you can answer the question. I personally find video game is a good way to enjoy my life. Though I agree that the hamster wheel and rat-race pretty sucks, but I just don't see much alternative at this point if I want to keep doing what I do now..."
Tell me reasons to live. I've been so stressed lately and my life just keeps getting worse.,You asking for reasons is the biggest reason of all.
Started punching my face. Yesterday i hated myself so much that i punched my face a few times... Its time for me to get help... tuesday iam going in a psychiatry,"I started this a little while ago too. Don't do it often, once every few months or so when I get really worked up and I start losing myself. Thing is, I like it. Not in a weird kinky way lmao but like, man it just gets me so revved up ya know? Like after I feed myself a few shots with each hand and I can feel the side of my face starting to swell up I feel like I can take on the fucking world head on. It's something that has actually made me heavily consider taking up boxing because it's win win. I get to punch something AND I get to get punched in the face back."
"Good things are happening, yet I've been on the verge of tears for days.. I've quit an awful job, got my old brilliant job back and just found out I passed an exam vital to progressing in my career. Yet, all I want to do is break down and cry. Maybe it's the weather and dark days. I don't know anymore","I feel this way too. For me, it's a strange feeling because I'm constantly on the verge of the tears but if I try and let myself cry, I can't."
"I had a relapse. I had a relapse and cut last night. Im so tired, sore, and hurt. I just want the pain to end. To top it all off if someone sees the cuts ill be sent back to the hospital","You have done your best, and therefore this cannot be called failing! No matter how long you have managed to abstain from self-harm, this is an achievement that no one can take away from you. You have learnt ways to cope and live life without self-harming because you did it for four Therefore, you are starting with more knowledge than you had when you stopped self-harming for the first time."
"As a therapist, I became the patient. Exactly a year ago I treated a patient with depression, always in bed with a smelly dark room, no hope. Now I became that patient myself, and although I can relate to him now, I fucking hate my joke for a life.","Yeah I'm working a PSW job and it pains me to see these people who are forced to or even worse don't have anything to do but lay in bed. You see the effects of social isolation and the lack of control. I work with a person with ABI and as much he tries to stay positive, the frustration seeps out of him all the time. The little things we take for granted like going to the bank, buying groceries, picking up prescriptions become so regulated and standardized in their lives, that you can't expect any other reaction but frustration. It's affected my personal life with my relatives because I get so angry thinking about how there is no way to make them better and I lash out for the littlest reasons on them. I understand it's all about perspective but in the already depressed state I'm in, I know I'm not cut out to help other people feel better. Putting in my 2 weeks on April 16th, and heading back to school in May. I can't keep working there, it's making me much more emotional than when I started."
Maybe I'm just addicted to misery. I seem to only want to do things that make me unhappy. WTF is wrong with me?,"Hard to end the spiral. Like the post above says, find out where you can break the feedback loops and go little by little."
I deserve to die alone.. That way I don't drag anyone else down with me.,"No one deserves to be alone. You sound like you're going through a hard time. I am, too, but lately I've been feeling more confident and hopeful. What's bothering you? You seen like you might think you'll be alone forever."
"Sleep is always a factor in controlling my depression. When I lack sleep or even the fog just kept being heavy and heavier each time. Even people notice it, that when sleepy or sleep, my face looked scary to them. Is anyone else like this?","I have major issues with sleeping too much. I can't sleep when I want to at night and then I sleep all day. I set an alarm to wake me up at 12 and usually snooze it for an hour. If I turn it off then I don't get up until 4PM. I can't say I get any sort of fog feeling though, just incredibly tired."
I.... just always depressed.. I ever think doing the right thing.,Me too..depression clouds our judgment. It gets really hard to think about things clearly. Hate this feeling but it won't go away yet.
Well she left me time to take a lot of pills and hopefully die. fuck everything i hate myself for being so fucking pathetic,its not about her as such its more so like the fact i tried again and failed. but you know i hate swallowing pills so i doubt ill be able to swallow enough to kill me. I am up to about 11 so far
"I gotta admit, depression has made quite strong man. Feels good to feel emotionally strong","a cool way of looking at it, I have never felt that way but I hope I can one day. Cheers!"
I haven't been to class in a month. lol I've just stopped going and absolutely stopped giving a Fuck. At some point with the depression you just become completely numb. I have 0 motivation to go. I haven't really left bed in a month,"I never go to class. It sucks how badly my depression, anxiety and PTSD ruin my motivation to even get out of bed...."
"I don’t understand. I have a relatively good life. No money issues, physically fit. Just that my familial relations are a little strained. So why do I feel this way? I feel like I have a reason to feel like this, and that just being ungrateful.","Chemical imbalance in your brain, its alright , happened a lot of time for a lot of people"
"Natural products to improve mood. Hi, Any sugestions on natural products to improve mood? I just need to be more happy and positive. Thanks",like what . eat bananas i heard it can make the person little happy
Back to feeling awful.. Was feeling good past few weeks but tonight I have this horrible sinking feeling in my chest and I want to cry but can't I feel so shit.,"Same. Was feeling good a few weeks ago after dealing through a rough break up but then life hits you sometimes and it fucking sucks. I hope you're doing well, OP. If you'll ever need somebody I'm just a chat away"
Next time I go drinking I'll find the biggest guy in the room and ask him to punch me as hard as he can. This is a promise to myself I don't expect any replies.,Hopefully he's a nice guy and doesn't punch you
How could I be happy if nobody is happy with me?. And why would I want to live on?,"Hi there, you know that is a very good question and I used to have similar thoughts as you. I now have a question to ask you, why would other be happy with you when you are not happy with yourself? The thing is, we need to develop self love and self care first. Because without it, we will be too dependent on others and that becomes burdensome because no one's life is perfect and they all have their own issues to deal with. Even though other people wants to love you and support you, they can only do it to a certain extent. The rest of the void that you have inside of you can only be filled by yourself. I know you don't feel it but being able to learn to self love is the key to happiness because that is when you feel like your life is in your control again, not on others. I would recommend you to google how to self love or seek therapy to talk this over and find out what your root cause is. There is always help and a better life when you decide to become better and healthier. I speak from experience. You will get better, believe in yourself."
"Does anyones depression seem to get worse depending on time?. I've noticed that at night around 1:00 AM it seems my depression gets worse, I'm only wondering if someone has had something similar happen","Atleast I'm not alone in this situation, also that really sucks"
"25. Dead end job. No motivation. Girlfriend who deserves way more. Poor. Live with parents. Fat. Ugly. No skills. Smoke weed everyday. Pop xanax, hydrocodone, drink prometh/codeine, eat shrooms, rack lines. I can't cope. Currently crying myself to sleep . :') hope your guys' night is going well","Not sure if this is much help... but someone once told me, If you keep dancing with the devil, you'll still feel like you're in Hell. Good luck friend."
"Didn't kill myself today, is that a win?. Oh it's 12:30am now, I guess it's still early.",hell yes thats a win! Keep fighting and try running some laps. It'll make you feel great!
"Does anyone care, or is it all just fake?. If you present a confident image, I see often that is only when people care. If you are struggling, or if you call them out on their b.s., then no one cares.",i feel like its mostly fake which sucks about people fuck them
How do I deal with parents who don't really understand it?. My dad thinks its just something that sets me off when I decide to cut so he asks what sets me off constantly and when I say i dont know he says Well there HAS to be something thats triggering it. He also tells me I need to get out more and just generic stuff.,What would you want your parents to change about what they do?
Wake up. Lie in bed for hours. Cry. Eventually force myself out of bed only to sit at my computer for the rest of the day. Repeat.. I'm a sack of shit.,"Youre not the only one crying today, I hate today."
"My brain is too busy.. Why is my brain always going going going? It's like having a radio turned on full volume in my head 24 hours a day. And now that I've been taking sertraline I have vivid nightmares, too, so sleeping doesn't offer me any peace. I'm so tired",I share your thoughts. My therapist suggested that the reason why I could be so thin is because my body burns so much energy in my brain because it is constantly going around around. It's such a pain &gt;: It would be nice for once to be calm.
I miss him. I miss my first boyfriend. He did very terrible things to me in the end and literally messed up my emotions. It's been like 3 months and I haven't thought about him anymore until a week ago. He's starting to haunt me more and more. Please help...,"As that was your first ever boyfriend, I understand you missing him. If I ever get a first girlfriend, I would miss her too. However, this guy did terrible things to you. There are other guys out there who will love you and treat you with respect. Good luck"
Young depression.. I heard toddlers can get depressed. Is this true?,I'm convinced that I was born depressed. As a child I cried more so than other children my age. I still cry and I'm in my mid\-thirties. I think I did read somewhere that some people are born with a gene that makes them more susceptible to depression but it doesn't necessarily mean they will have depression when they get older.
Elevated mood for ~6 hours then back to hell?. Anyone else have an elevated mood for a couple hours then right back to depressed? Seems like go a week or two not wanting to live then be on top of the world only for this pattern to repeat itself a few hours later,"Highs and lows, just the cycle of depression, the key is understanding what set you down that low, a bad test score, relationship issues, new work load, money issues. Then once you can identify your triggers you can make some plans to avoid them or change what made you drop in the first place"
Why do i have to exist. Why was i born to experience this endless suffering,I know if this is comforting but there is no reason why. You just were born. I get the same thought as you often. I think of how there is much more net suffering than net joy in life. But honestly it just feels that way since been more severely depressed (just a couple of months) I have hope that at some point i can get back to feeling better. It may take a few more months even. But even just thinking back to how I used to feel makes me realize that there is hope.
Attempting it tonight. If I had a gun it would way much easier .,"Please don't. I know you hurt. I do, too. But we both still have something left to offer to the world."
"I hate my mind. social anxiety, bipolar, depression... litteraly what kind of brain did god give me. why do I constantly want to kill myself. I have no friends, no where to vent so im doing it on here ig now.","Genetics are a bitch. I have depression and anxiety throughout my entire family. No one batted an eye when I told my mom I wanted to kill myself in 10th grade. It was like ahh she's arrived at the depression, we've been waiting for this. Like it was puberty or something. I don't want to die anymore but everyday is a struggle for happiness and taming my anxiety feels like a full time job. You're not alone my friend."
"Another lunch period alone.. It seems like this happens to me at least once a month... still don't have any friends, still not sure if I'll survive past high school...","Thats why i hated high school, the person who sits alone(at least at my old high school) always ends up getting made fun of and laughed at, its ridiculous and stupid. I was always one to ask people who sat alone if they wanted to sit with me and my friends. I can't understand why they would make fun of someone. Hang in there man."
I see people happily celebrating Christmas with their loved ones and I feel happy for them but then I take one look at myself and all I can think of is how I’m just so tired and how much I want to get intoxicated so I can forget about everything. I look forward to New Years either. miserable.,"Why Bro? Bad year i know, me too. But why? Have a nice days ;)"
"What do you do when you're in an unhappy relationship, but you don't have the personal strength to end it?. Just endure till one of you dies?","You pick yourself up and you tell your partner how you're feeling. If there's nothing that can be done to save the relationship, tell your partner. Remember that you loved them once and really you don't want them being with someone who doesn't love them either."
"One week. Im gonna kill myself soon. Give me a reason not to. Il probably just shit on it though. Ive cried everyday since november 28, 2015. Please help me.",What happened on Nov 28th?
What is it like to seek help as a minor. 14 years old and am depressed and have issues with anxiety and self harm. If i tried to seek help with a doctor what process would I go through and what would most likely happen. in the U.S. if it makes a difference,"it *probably* depends on the state (edit: what state in the US). being 14, you are going to be tethered to your parent/guardian legally. the therapist/counselor/psychologist will be legally required to tell your guardians of anything that serves of specific risk. for example, i told my therapist that i was suicidal and he had to contact my mother and explain the basics of the situation. for self harm, im not sure exactly how/if the information would be disclosed by the therapist/counselor/psychologist to your parents.. but im assuming if you are physically hurting yourself to a GREAT EXTENT then yes, it would most likely be disclosed. im 18 now, and started seeing my on-campus(university) therapist and psychiatrist at the beginning of the school year, where i was 17. it sucks not being in control of your life, but what can you do, you know? if getting to see a therapist is an issue, i would recommend asking to talk to your doctor/pediatrician in private (during a normal check-up) and say tht youve had symptoms of depression/anxiety and you'd like to have some help talking to your parent about getting help. if it's not an issue of talking to your parent/guardian, then what's the worry? if you cant see a doctor, a school counselor could help you have this conversation with your parent! or even a supportive teacher that you trust. i went through a very similar situation when i was younger, and very much regret not being more persistent about getting help when i needed it. it mght not go away, and with school only getting harder and more stressful as you age, it's *really hard* to deal with all this emotional baggage. everyone deserves to feel the best that they can. you dont want to suffer anymore and someday you wont! feel free to pm me, i'd be happy to be your pen-pal through all this &lt;3"
Is the good even worth it?. idek anymore. Too much bad...,The good is worth it! Hang in there! You can get through this because you're stronger than this! You can make it through cause the good will be worth it! Lots of love!
Medication interaction??!!. So I'm on 100mg sertraline(zoloft) a day and have been for about a year. Today I had some candy and some were grapefruit flavour and I didn't realise..... Grapefruit reacts with sertraline(zoloft) and I'm freaking out.... Will I be okay???,"You will be fine! I would suggest, sit down with a glass of water and do anything too intensive. Let us know how you feel later on. :)"
Mental health services can kiss my ass!!. They don't help with shit,"I've had the same experience with them, but I think the problem was that I wasn't opening up to my therapist. Don't give up just yet!"
Anybody else trying to drink until they don't wake up tomorrow?. Shit i dont wanna experiecne another day tbh,"Currently? No. But 12 days ago I drank until I blacked out just trying to forget my feelings and forget everything until morning. My subconscious, drunk brain had other plans. I tried to hang myself from a bridge but luckily was too drunk to execute it. I ended up with broken bones in both my feet, a required 5 day stay in a hospital behavior and addiction unit, and no memory of what I had done or even ever feeling suicidal. 12 days sober and have accepted that I have a binge drinking problem. You can only drown your sorrows for so long before they explode outward - one way or another. I am happy to help any way I can."
"How to feel when everyone you care about would be better off without you.

I just lost a battle on HS because of my stupid wifi connection and makes me want to die. Why am I so unlucky? Why always me and not others? I mean, it occasionally happens, but I struggle even on videogames now. It feels so fucking horrible to not be good in what you used to be good. Depression sucks. I feel you."
I feel it most of the time. Do you ever feel it? Like you just want to disappear in this world without someone knowing you disappear??,"been feeling it all the time for years now, its like tried so hard to make it better but it go away"
I always send the last text message. No one gives a shit about me,I used to be very hurt by that-- but now I just focus on how the relationship feels when we're in person. I may be the last to text but if we can get together and it feels like we haven't missed a beat-- I'm cool.
I stared into the abyss and it made the abyss feel akward.. Not even the abyss likes me :|,"legend says if you add anime subtitles, its going to translate the abyss' love for you."
"Why do I come on here just hoping someone will notice what I have to say, just to feel some sense of self worth.. I know, I'm pathetic and stupid for wanting to feel seen, but I can't help it...",You are seen! We care about you here. Its not always a booming because everyone is so sad themselves but we look out for eachother here
Haven't had suicidal thoughts for a week now.. I feel... decent. I haven't thought about suicide even if my mind has been clouded with anxiety and I almost had a panic attack in the middle of class. I guess this is kind of a milestone. Let's just hope next week doesn't shit on me.,I'm so happy for you! This is definitely a good sign.
tonight. I give up im done with this bs depression had for years. not gonna into detail about how i came to this decision as nobody really cares. killing myself tonight and my final decision bye.,"Hey man, wanna talk before you do that? I wanna know what's on your mind. I'm just curious and I actually DO care. Please just don't do something that's permanent for an issue that is temporary. Message me"

Think of all the reasons you have to live!. 1. My parents would be traumatized if I killed myself That's it. That is the single reason I have for living.,I hate being told that. Do people think we haven't thought about it before?
"oh no. I'm scared that I'm slowly falling back into this. I've been ridiculously irritable these past days and I haven't left my house nor want to leave it, all I want to do is to just lay in bed and isolate myself from everybody. Also I'm feeling the sudden desire to fall back and stay in the hole???? which is something that happened to me when I was depressed af a couple of months ago, I don't understand what's going on.","Remember what your mother did to you the other night? That is what is going on, I imagine. Bed beckons but you won't find comfort there. Get out of the house, seek company. You won't be much fun but we are social animals, we are programmed to calibrate our mood meter with reference to others. Hang out with healthy people, your mood will lift somewhat. Isolate and it can go into free fall."
Here again. Drinking my tirst.. Im at a bar listening to trash music. Feel free to ask anything. Unlike the people here.   Edit: Judging by the /r you can quess my mood,What trash music is on?

"Everyone who has attempted, did you get that feeling of absolute calm once you decided?. After I decided it's happening, I felt a calm close to euphoria. Went through my day, got everything ready, it was so calm in my mind, Wondering if anyone else did.","You go from momentary relief to slipping and losing your footing while clawing your way back to the opposite direction you downward spiraled in, which may or may not avoid the eternal pit that yearns for an alternate option being sanctuary."
"This is all my fault.. all this hatred and anger its all me, I control my emotions and i pushed people away because of it. All this rage it makes me feel good, but at the same time it Why do i do this to myself? Become my own worst enemy.","Sorry to hear you have been going through a rough time. Emotions can be hard to control and anger can be an easy out. It lets you feel powerful, in control of things. In therapy they teach you to sit-down often and sort through your emotions. What emotion are you experiencing right now? How do you identify it? What caused you to feel like this? What steps can you make to prevent this feeling? Try to walk yourself through some of these exercises. They might help you better understand your emotions so that you can control them in the future."
Is this a good way to hack my brain to go to gym? lol. GYM = pain I hate myself = I want to can I use this thinking to me to go to the GYM with the objective to myself? Is someone capable of such power? Haha,"What are your goals? Take away any kind of emotional association you have and focus on your goals and just do it. Most people like going to the gym, but most people like to be unhealthy. Just do it."
"How am I supposed to pick a career path, when my only interest is sleeping?. Just get me out of here. Kill me.",This is too real for me.
I want to die but I'm scared.. Maybe it's just a physiological natural evolutionary thing that keeps living things alive but I don't like it. Of course there's also guilt.,the thing about suicide is that harder to do it yourself. Sometimes me and my friends wish we could die by accident so we have to take the responsibility of doing it ourselves. All the things that happen after to our or friends is a scary thought too. Those are things that make it hard for me to kill myself. Maybe you relate
Cooking/Nutrition for Depression. I'm having trouble keeping up with basic cooking. What are the easiest/healthiest meals I can have to keep my nutrition up? I've been eating so many plain turkey sandwiches.,"Can you just get one of those packages of pre-washed spinach and add those to your sandwiches as a start? Take what you have working for you and try to cram as many nutrients in as possible. Spinach is a good choice because it's pretty nutrient dense as opposed to lettuce, and it's easy to add to stuff. You can even grab a can on minestrone (or any other type) soup, heat it up and dump a bunch of spinach into it to boost the vegetable content. My go to recently has been a spinach salad with goat cheese and balsamic vinaigrette dressing. Maybe some day I'll get fancy and add onions or peppers or whatever to make it a real salad, but at this point, it's better than the grilled cheese by itself or whatever else I'm eating. Baby steps, man. Baby steps."
why do i constantly cry for help and turn it down when i ACTUALLY get help. i feel like such an attention whore,"When I felt this way, I came to the conclusion that I didn't know who I was without these feelings. I didn't know what I liked anymore, would I be empty without this sadness? That sort of thought process, it was a lot of fear that drove me away from help. It's natural to be afraid of things changing. But when you feel ready to, these changes are for the better."
The fact that I'm stuck being ME until the day I die is disheartening. I wish I was someone else.,"I wouldn't want to give my depression to anyone else, it's too much to deal with myself and giving it to someone else would make me feel even lower."
My 100% is a normal persons 25%. God fucking dammit life is so fucking exhausting. I'm struggling to just barely take care of myself and even that is pushing it. Jesus fuck I want to die,"i like the statement, suffering is just part of life. i believe this to be true. i think we actually LEARN, not cognitively, but emotionally, that sometimes many of us just go thru these spells of suffering/depression. a solid 10 years here! just in the past 2 years am i starting to feel KINDA like a NORMAL person again"
"I want to be someone's favorite. Though I've had many best friends, I've never been anyone's best friend. I have fallen deeply in love with a few people but no one has ever looked twice at me. I feel like the biggest, loneliest piece of shit in the whole universe. I'm just so fucking tired.","You're not alone. The few really close friends I've had have all moved overseas, and moved on with their lives. I'm all alone in the city I grew up in. It's a surreal feeling. For each day that passes I feel more and more antisocial, and it only gets harder to reach out to people, and the more time I spend alone, the less I have to say to the people around me. It's a vicious circle and I don't know how to escape it."
"I have come to terms with the fact that I am unlovable. Just because I've accepted it doesn't make it hurt any less. I wish I want disabled, I wish I wasn't ugly, I wish I was at least average height, I wish I was confident. That, or I wish I was dead. I can't handle being this lonely any longer.","I have that feeling too... but then I read it can be one of the symptoms of PTSD, so I really don't know what to think about it"
"You know that last day of summer feeling?. That's how I feel everyday. Just sad, quiet, on my own. The fun is over, the sun is down, everyone has gone home, Im still outside and I'm not moving forward, I'm ignoring the future, I'm stuck in the present. It's always the last day of summer for me.","It seems I feel that way all the time too, but my anxiousness goes up and down."
Someone just asked me if I'm choosing to be depressed.. Do you honestly think I want to feel this way?,"At some level I still think it is a choice. A million different choices. For me at least. On my bad days/weeks/months/years I am so paralyzed by anxiety and depression and apathy for living that I sleep all day and avoid everything. I avoid life. I want do die, but am too lazy to do anything about it. When I take initiative to do things, work on a project, clean stuff, I feel so much better. I loose myself in my task and all those heavy feelings of hopelessness stay away for awhile. Maybe it is just me, maybe I am just lazy. Idk, but that is my life experience."
"I will always love you. Here's to another sleepless night. Here's to more tears. I sleep in the comfort of your flannel. It makes me feel safe. I'm reading and learning as much as I can to help you. I know you start your new job tomorrow, so good luck. Love always, thorwaway0909",So many feels. Here to chat if you'd like. I'm going through a similar thing at the moment and it's tearing me apart.
Lexapro and Abilify. Has anyone been on this combination? If so can you give some insight?,"on it right now, but I be much help as I have been known to be treatment resistant and for me it does about the same as the rest as in it more so numbs me to all feeling but is not as strong as others in that way so i still sunk low quite a bit, but on like 7 or 8 different meds in the past 6 years so my experience mean to much, I hope it works great for you though. If you mind me asking what is the dosage your on for them?"
Christmas spirit. Anyone else just not give a shit about Christmas? I used to love Christmas and get so excited about it. Now its just like any other day or even more I don't like it.,That's every holiday for me bud.
"Anyone else really fucking scared of death and what comes after but daily wishes to stop existing?. That's where I'm at, scared shitless about what could happen after (if anything happens at all) but still suicidal daily.","Yeah. I'm afraid of a painful death. I'm afraid of dying itself. Does my consiousness just stop? Does it feel like before I was born? Is there something afterward? Both heaven and hell sound terrible. I don't want to stop having my body, it's like my home. But then at the same time I hate it here. Daily conversations are robotic and empty. People are rude and selfish. Everyone is obsessed with fast cars and big houses and parties... but none of it means anything. I'm just so tired. I want to run away and build my own hut in the forest."
I'm all the way down now. I can see all the way to the bottom...,I'm sorry you are feeling this way. We are here for you.
What if depressed people are the sane ones?. I think some people don't care about nothing in this life because they're conscious that nothing really matters and they are the ones who can see the real mediocrity that is the world. (Sorry for the grammar I'm italian),"There are actually some studies that support this: depressed people are more likely to correctly assess probabilities and risk/reward in many situations. However, we also have documentable thought process issues, the primary being black and white thinking, all-or-nothing. So I don't think we get to claim to be the sane ones. ;)"
Need help. What are some painless ways to commit sucide?,"The most painless way is to keep living. Nothing is more painful than a beautiful life taken from us. Please please please let someone help you tell the people you care about, give them a chance to help or you will rip a void through their hearts. I don't know what your going through but I know you don't wish this pain upon anyone especially those you love. If I could carry this for you I would and my heart is already breaking just thinking about how you might feel. Don't do it."
I'm not depressed since being on drugs actually they've made me happy.... Wired thing is now I just want to die happy.. happy days a,"I can get that, but the feeling's only temporary, isn't it? An hour or two maybe depending on what exactly, but still. Those things always run out and I find myself being broke not long later, having to lend or beg relatives, yadda yadda yadda. I hate it, but love it at the same time because that always seems to pay off. Sure, I don't have the right mindset for this thing - drugs are bad, and so on and so on but whatever works works. Just make sure it works and doesn't make it worse is my advice."
"I gonna beat you down, depression.. And you all gonna do the same.",missed you a lot! Are you doing well?
"Is it weird to tie my identity up to my desired career choice (research and cures). Since I am too busy for a life, and thus things that go with it (like hiking,biking, traveling), is it ok to predicate my identity of a potential soon to be (and desired) job?",I don't think that's weird at all. Just don't forget that you're still the same person you were before you changed how you think of yourself.
Mushroom Effectiveness?. I've read about mushrooms for depression and I'm tempted to try it. Has anyone here done this? Did it work? How long does the relief from depression last? Thanks,tried it personally. One friend told me whenever he does shrooms he depressed for at least a month afterwards. But bad trips are also a risk.
"Couldn't go through with killing myself, where do I go now?. As soon as i starting breathing in water, I decided I wanted to live. Now I'm here. What am I supposed to do with this meaningless existence? I try and try and try. I work hard at everything. It doesn't seem to matter, there is just a void always looming every single day of my life. I don't want to live, I don't want to die. Maybe Earth really is hell, except there is no heaven.",isn't this me in a bubble
Happy birthday to me. I guess. Looks like it's time to get drunk and lay on the couch. Again.  Happy birthday to me,"Happy birthday love, have a great one!"
I've done everything possible to prove I'm worth loving.. Yet here I am. Alone.,"i totally get that shit. seriously i do. i was just asking, i was just wondering. maybe your one of the lucky ones meant to wait for their real love to come. giving my situation id of totally preferred that, then being torn apart with bad relationships causing all sorts of insecurities. being lonely sucks, but being broken any better.. be"
Mental Health support. Mom says try harder. A doctor prescribes me pills. A councillor gives me kindergarten-level reading material and handouts. The internet gives me a phone number. Friends give me absence. The psychiatric ward gives me a doctor. But repeat after me... I have mental health support.,"Oh I know. In my opinion the true reason that you, me and about 90% of people with depression feels the way you portrayed in this post is because out of all those people who are support. no one really understands on a deep, emotional, and philosophical level how this disorder ruins your life and makes it miserably painful. The ONLY way you know is if you have experienced it yourself. Once you get truly depressed you enter the void. Some people are only in that void for some brief time, while clinically depressed people like ourselves live in this void. That support group doesn't speak our language. That's the fucking problem. They don't know the void. They can only read about the void, but they don't live in it. The support group approaches depression in the same way that males know what it's like to go through childbirth (no this is not a political push either way). It's just stating, THEY DONT but they can read all about it and try to imagine the pain, but they can never truly feel it. The subjective nature of emotions and life makes it beyond Fucking difficult to find people who know what you are truly talking about at your personal level."
"im so tired. I just wanna be done, I have no hope, I have no future... hell I don't WANT a future... why can't I just be done?","I am 31 yrs old and am in college myself. I dropped out during my first college career due to, you guessed it, mental health issues. College is hard. LIFE is hard. But honey, there are people who love you. People who care way less about your college degree and debt than they do about your happiness. Look into your university's mental health services. Counseling is a sympathetic ear who will NEVER downplay things bringing you stress. I've been depressed. I've been suicidal. The worst part is the sincere feeling that nothing will EVER get better. Well, I want to tell you that IT WILL. While there's life, there's hope. Please PM me if you need support. I've been where you are. It sucks, but it can be overcome."
Our purpose is to suffer. And I'm fucking done with it,Trust me I am done with it too and you dont suffer alone bro so find comfort in that
I don't feel ok. I am acutely aware of my own heartbeat right now. I feel like I have nothing to live for anymore... I just wanna be happy,Happiness won't come to you; you have to hunt for it.
Depressed that I'll never find love.. My biggest fear is not finding love.I see all of my friends having girlfriends and stuff and I am sitting here and wasting my time doing nothing.I've had a few relationships but all of them crashed and burned.,"This may be a tough concept to accept, but you should be happy that other's have that something you lack. Be honest with yourself, do you see all of those relationships your friends have lasting for decades? Finding love is complex. I wouldn't say you're wasting your time doing nothing. I've seen this too many times, where people spend days after days trying to find the one. That just now how it works. Although it is true that if you don't look, you won't find in most cases. You shouldn't fear not finding love. 'Cause that's just not how it works. I wouldn't say love finds you either, that's also not how it works. I wouldn't ponder too much about not finding the one or love. Time will tell, it will come. During that time, try to be alright with yourself by being just yourself. You want to be with someone because you want to be with them, not because you fear being lonely. Give it time. Talk to your friends. Enjoy yourself."
"Life is the greatest gift. Nah, even wrong sized socks would've been better.",It's not a gift it's a fucking chore
"Today is my birthday. And no one cares; and really, why should anyone? I am universally hated and even besides that point, no one's obliged to congratulate another person's birth. I mean, everybody's born at one point. It's not an achievement to be proud of to say the least.",happy birthday. i still feel birthdays are worth celebrating by ourselves.
"Bored therefore depressed,depressed therefore bored. does anyone else feels that way?","I feel a similar way, when that happens I play chess or read something interesting. Sometimes nothing works and I just sit there..."
"I had the worst depressive episode of my entire life... so I decided to ask my crush out. She said, just not looking for anything right now, I hope we can still be I love my why I decided to sleep for 20 straight hours and now I feel exactly the same","I mean you had the balls to ask her out in the first place , you got further than a lot of other people with their crushes because they are too scared to ask them. Just because she said no mean the end of the world bro, even though it might seem like that. Keep your head up"
Im a deeple confused and flawd person. And i hate myself for it everyday,"We all are, and that's ok."
"Zoloft. How long does it take to fucking work and any past experience or current with it and how it was because I'm on day two Edit: Any side effects I should worry about like weight gain, being a zombie, or orgasm issues.",It takes a week or two to build up in your system
"How to over cognitive impairment from depression??. I used to be the smart kid in the class before I became depressed!! I would do the work but it would be easy because I payed so much attention in class. I did well in school exams (Not as well as I could have but better than average) and have been in and out of college since due to indecision and anxiety from my depression. Giving it another go and I am so stupid!! I can't pay attention to anything. How can I get rid of this grogginess and be as alert as I used to be? I know exercise should help, but what kinds and how much? And are there weird foods I should eat? (Heard turmeric and black pepper in smoothies? And omege 3 supplements)",IME supplements are worth nothing when it comes to serious brain fog. Are you on medication?
why is life so terrible. everything seems so terrible you work everyday for a boss who makes more than you ever will and its all so you can then buy pointless stuff from other bosses who makes more than you ever will what a load of pointless garbage,That's it. You've discovered how things work. What now?
My suicidal thought is imploding on me and I AM EXTREMELY MOTIVATED to do it. I am afraid I will do something.... My hands are shaking... and my heart is physically hurting.,"Alright breathe. Its going to be okay. Your adrenaline is pumping and you're not thinking clearly. Take a moment step outside, get a snack or some thing to drink. Its going to be okay. Unfortunately, you didn't give any description so I'm not sure what I can help you with but man...I can tell you one thing. Things sure do have a funny way of fixing itself or getting better even when you least expect it to. Keep your chin up."
"In the last days, I've experienced how to be okay. Now it's over.. Hello, laziness and suicidal thoughts.",What was it that made you feel okay and has it ended?
I'm uncapable of making my life better. Whatever I try i fuck up and it's even worse,You need to remember that word is bond. One thing that I'm trying really hard to do is to be a best friend to myself. Would i tell my best friend she's incapable of making her own life better? No. I would tell her... yeah you've been having a really hard time and that's understandable but you're strong and you're loved and you're amazing and you have a big heart and mind. You can do this and I'm going to be here for you the whole time.

I want to hear your ideas cause im all out","I struggle to find one at times honestly. But I just keep putting one foot in front of the other kinda hopin that one day I will wake up and it will all be alright. However, each day that passes that hope that everything will be alright dims just a little bit more."
I feel like I'm slowly spiralling again. and I'm so frustrated at myself I should be grateful for the life I have; the people I have but I feel nothing but a gnawing emptiness I want to be there for people I care about but I'm just such a mess and I'm exhausted.,"It might help to know not alone , had everything someone could ever want but no draw to anything for me no pleasure just emptiness"
I’m going to kill myself in a week. I just thought someone should know,"Please maybe someday soon something will go right, happen for me but maybe for you"
"Goodbye. Edit: still alive for now, because of you guys ^^","The thing that makes me sad about death is that once you do it, you can't undo it. Like once you do it no one can ever talk to you again, your thoughts, ideas, feelings all vanish. I guess all of that doesn't matter anyways in the big picture, but it still makes me sad. And think about it. I don't know how old you are, but all the time and resources that went into raising you and feeding you and just growing. I feel it's a shame to waste so much. However, on the other side of the coin, you won't have to sustain yourself anymore... I'm just making this worse, aren't I?"
Jealousy sucks. Jealousy is going to ruin my relationships because I fear that I'll lose what's close to me. I don't know how to deal with it.,"Could you provide more details? How is jealousy negatively impacting your relationships, specifically?"

Someone jumped in front of a train near my house and I can't help feeling jealous.. I wish I could be that brave.,Lay down with your neck on the tracks. Maybe a tarp over your body so they're less likely to notice?
"How do I know how to decide between seeing a therapist or a psychologist or a life coach ?? Please help. I am a 22 year old male, I work 2 part time jobs, I suffer from depression and loneliness and social anxiety and low self esteem, I don't know what to do with my life and what to do with myself. Which category should I seek help from ?","Hi, I hope you are doing okay today. If you have never scene anyone, I would recommend a therapist like a LCSW (licensed social worker). In my experience, the type of care you get is less important than the connection you feel with the provider. So I over think it too hard. Instead, put that energy towards finding the right person. Which means calling lots of places, talking to a lot of people and listening to your gut. Have a good one"

"My depression makes it so hard to be productive at work. I've been sitting here for over an hour and written one sentence for this assignment, and I'm getting behind on other responsibilities.

"Sorry, but I absolutely hate myself. Just needed to express this, to someone. Loneliness, you know?","I know the feel, I just know why"
Suicide is not the answer...well.... Then why do more and more people do it? Lmao.,"Simply because it is an answer. When people put definitive statements out there, they are also putting out there it is not the answer for them and for normal society. As a two-time suicide survivor and multiple abuse survivor, I know I can't fault anyone for doing what they do. It sucks to have someone kill themselves, but there was so much pain and suffering that they couldn't bare it any longer. I know, I've seen that demon more than once."
7 Years.... My Mother informed me that yesterday was the seven year anniversary of my first knee surgery. It's been seven years since I've been able to walk without a limp. Who would ever want someone so broken both physically and mentally?,"Ok, you walk with a limp and that probably sucks. Still, a lot of things you can do. I'm sure it's not as off-putting as you feel it is. Does your limp make you depressed or is there more?"
No one can relate. No one. You are all innocent good people. I'm so alone in this. No one can relate to me. I don't belong here. I'm feeling terrible every day all day. Help. Something. I'm crying on my floor like always. I am so tired of living. It's so hard. The worst thing is that I don't feel like you. I don't feel apathy. I feel constant disgust over myself. I can't stand it,I can relate to what you're feeling. It's very easy to be disgusted by yourself when people are either berating you or not acknowledging your presence. What's making you feel this way?
"If I don't find a job by the May 31, I'm out.. I'm keeping this here as a reminder. If I'm still unemployed by May 30, I'm ending my life.

I just have to force myself out of this state of perpetual idleness, anything's better than that.","I've tried doing that myself for my goals, doctors didn't like it since I'm a diabetic and therefore ended up in hospital with a huge hypo. :'( Atleast it ended the misery of daily life for a few days I guess.......

How can I tell my mom that I have depression and why without crying?. Crying near people is the worst,"You really shouldn't be ashamed to cry in front of your mom.

"Can someone help me. I had a 3.7 gpa, captain of my freshman football team and life was smooth. Now I’m in the 2nd semester my gpa has gone to 2.0 and im unmotivated to do anything. I don’t know what’s wrong or how to fix it.. I let anyone find out.","Talk with your teachers, ask how you can get caught up and back in the swing of things. Most teachers would be happy to have you reach out, plus by being in communication with them, they'll be there to help keep your motivation up. Work out a plan for each class on how to raise grades, maybe see if you can stay before or after school with one of them to have them monitor you while you work. I hate to say this, but school academics come over sports. If time mangement is becoming hard, maybe ask if you can lower yourself from captian position. Freshmen year is easiest for most, so you might want to get help now to save yourself from only deciding to change say in junior year. I'm sorry your mental illness is having an affect like this, but the first step is admitting you want help which you've done so good job! I'll be rooting for you."
"such a catch 22. I have to *do* things to feel better, but I don't feel well enough to drum up the energy to *do* them. My whole life is an exercise in saying 'I should be doing... x/y/z...but nope'.","Music had always affected my moods depending on what I listen to. When I need a boost of happiness or motivation I like to listen to Alexander desplat or Hans zimmer or James horner. Honestly, I am just a huge orchestra person and, since it doesn't have lyrics, I can pretend it's the soundtrack to my life and feel more courageous to get moving. There's also another user (I wish I could remember where or who it was) but they suggested doing at least one thing whenever you get up to go pee or get water. Then, you can push it to doing two things when you feel more motivated. Please be kind and have patience with yourself. Depression is an ongoing war with many battles. Celebrate your wins and don't berate yourself when you're not doing as well as you wish. Take baby steps you can easily accomplish and grow from there. I hope you have a great day tomorrow and if you ever need some support, just send me a PM hugs in the meantime"
Crazy thoughts. Planning to end it all soon .,Do you want to talk about it?  (I realized that sentence kinda sounds sarcastic wasn't meant to be)
Anyone else feel like they don't deserve a partner?. Sometimes I think about the baggage I carry with me and feel sorry for whoever gets stuck with a guy like me.,"Definitely. I want my ex back more than anything, we broke up over a year ago, she's got a kid with someone else now and it hurts a lot, but it was my fault. I wasn't the nicest person to be around sometimes, I did a lot of good in the relationship, but a lot of bad too. I'm not proud of it, I'm ashamed of it, I regret it all, I hate myself over the things I've done. I think that's what makes the breakup worse, knowing that it was my fault, that I could have saved it if I had just stayed on my medication. I keep trying to convince myself she broke my heart, but I broke both mine and hers through my actions. Still doesn't make it any less painful and I wish I could just end it all right now."
What if... What if you don't want to die but things aren't going to get better?,You try to make things better. And try. And try.
"Thinking of the future. When I think of the future, I feel so worthless. I feel like I will never achieve anything great after finishing university. It makes me feel more depressed about being alive. How do you cope with the future?","I try to cope by trying to keep my own goals from the past that were broken, alongside those i may make in the current time, intact for myself. Whether or not that can happen or if it's meant to be for me, i don't and honestly can't know, unless and until i get there from still trying. I am living, but not alive -- there is a difference; I'm trying to find completion for that void. I try to accept myself and my flaws -- even some of the current ones i want gone as i progress towards that. I still fight myself over that and/or other things at times. But i still try to accept and understand. I just keep going. For the sake of something i still believe in somewhere out there that might be befitting of me, as i want it. If it's there, i must get to it -- i must have it. At the same time, i must better myself until i am who and what I've always wanted to be, both in and out. The sense of failure and futility are always there -- i just keep trying to keep them level and not overwhelm me. I try to do things for myself i thought i had from others. Things i would truly want done to me by others. But there's nobody. I got used to it. Despite still wanting the opposite in my own humble way. I just think of what who might actually still exist out there, think and feel if i weren't doing this, willingly, to keep pushing. I keep trying to believe that regardless, i deserve things my way. After everything especially. That it can't all be for naught. I've yet to see that. That's why I'm still going for the future. Even if its path got shattered long-ago, many-a-time. I hope this helps."
Anyone ever feel weird saying you're depressed when you've never been clinically diagnosed. I'm pretty sure I have depression. However there's this constant fear that if I tell someone they won't believe me. If I tell my friends or family I'm depressed. I'll think they just won't believe you just because I should be happy because of how my life looks.,I feel you. When I wasn't diagnosed but was obviously depressed (looking back now) I was in denial and felt ashamed. I always said I feel depressed and not I am depressed
"I'm just fucking scared. I've always been out of pretty much every loop for one reason or another that was out of my control, and I feel like I am a victim of natural selection and nothing more. I can't see anything in my future, as there was quite literally nothing in my past. I am so goddamn scared. People say that it will be alright if you try, but everybody is trying, and I've been functioning under the fact that no matter how bad I do, someone has it worse, and the opposite holds true, and now I'm part of the standard deviation. I guess I always felt that if I tried too hard I wouldn't be 'down to earth', but the way things are now, I feel down to hell. I just want to have a chance, but thats too much to ask as technically I've been left with nothing except to mooch, and react to other people's lives. And be a fucking parasite beyond that. Fuck. Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck. Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuck. Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck.","Hi Friend, Someone will always it worse. This is true. But, I think that you should draw strength from the fact not that others have it worse, but that you know there is better. I certainly understand the feeling of the teeter totter between living in hell and trying too hard. Don't let the fear of being not down to Earth shackle you my friend. Reach out and grab for what makes you feel alive, because there is far more uncertainty in sitting back and watching. I truly feel that your reactions to other's lives highlights your ability to empathize and live. Harvest that energy for its beauty and not its sadness. Stay strong."
I got what I wanted. Why doesn’t it make me happy?. I still feel like a stupid piece of shit. not enough. still a fuck yo and at fault for everything.,What happened? Tell us. We'll listen.
"I seem to always be the first to try and help someone else with their problems, yet when I need help nobody seems to be around to be an open ear for me, I wish I had someone in real life who cared enough to listen to me and just let me spill everything out. Anyone else feel this way?","I'm not entirely certain what reaction you're getting, but I hope you'll give those around you a little slack if they can't be as openly receptive and caring as you need at first. I'm sort of the designated problem solver in my circle, so quite a few of my friends come to me for advice and sympathy. It's never, never a burden. Instead, it's an honor. They trust me with their secrets, their problems, and value my opinion enough to ask for it. Reverse the situation. Aren't you glad when someone comes to you? The thing is, not everyone is built for that. Especially, I have found, it can sort of weird people out when the Rock, the Stable One, the One Person In This Messed Up World Who Has Their Stuff Together needs help. I mean, here's the person they go to and they rely on when they need support... and that person needs support. Suddenly you're not Superman anymore and it can be a bit disconcerting. Perhaps try introducing A problem at a time, slowly, and seeing if they can get used to you also being a normal human with issues. Good luck!!"
"Has anyone doubted your condition and tell you that you’re not ill, so don’t believe what the doctors tell you?. affecting me. I often blame myself for being lazy, stupid, slow, incompetent and having a lousy work attitude.","My parents were the type who didn't believe in mental illness, it was just me being lazy and antisocial. Until I left home for college, I never thought I had mental problems, I just thought I was just a shitty person who couldn't do anything. At least to me, recognizing the illness and accepting that something is wrong was the beginning of recovery and bettering myself."
"Stupid. I wish I was stupid so I could make friends, and laugh with their stupidity!","What's stupid about them specifically, if I may ask?"
A close friend told me that I should do what I want and I'd be much happier.. My first thought was suicide.,What? As long as it's not directly physically hurting another person you should always do whatever makes you happy. And if it's suicide then that's not wrong. For some people suicide is the answer. To act like every single person ever will one day find a reason to want to live is ignorant and idiotic at best. Is there a chance you will? Of course. But to many people it's not worth continuing to live with something that they've dealt with for years at a chance of having it magically get cured.
"i need to bleed. which area is the most painful yet least dangerous to cut? i can handle physical pain, but i need this emotional anguish to go away.","Cutting the topside of my arms hurt and bled but they clotted pretty quickly. Please use a sterile blade if you're going to cut yourself, and don't go any deeper than just the surface skin. Take it from me as someone who has used self-harm, an infection is not the sort of pain that helps with emotional relief! I also recommend other methods, there are plenty out there that can cause some pretty gnarly pain but are far, far safer than cutting. Are there any taps in your house that have overly hot water? Boiling water shouldn't be used as it will scald and is just as prone to infection and other nasties as cutting, so just try clenching a fist under the regular hot water for a few seconds. On the other end of the scale I found the grabing an ice cube and squeezing as tight as I could helped! I thought it would just make my hand feel numb, but it creates a localised, sharp unbearable sensation that works wonders to distract me."
"Advice for when random depression hits at work. Yeah, basically the title. Does anyone have advice for dealing with anxiety and depression that hits randomly through the work day? It's been happening to me a lot now and I have a hard time pulling myself out of it.","I make a handwritten to-do list and then see what thing on the list strikes me as the least difficult to do. And then I do it, and don't think about anything but that task until it's done. Sometimes having a concrete list helps the anxiety/depression pass, and sometimes it just makes my day less overwhelming, so I'm at least able to get through the easiest and/or most important tasks."
"I feel so trapped and alone, I don't know what to do. I just feel cornered and I have no one to turn to. Life is just really bad right now and I have no family to lean on. They're emotionally abusive and my dad doesn't even want me anymore. It's really hard when you don't have a solid foundation at home.",I'm sorry your situation at home is so difficult. Do you have anyone in your life whom you trust enough to talk to about how you're feeling?
Anybody else just zone out when they're depressed?. It's like I'm not even there.,"I do. It's like you're on pause, but your problems aren't.."
"I told my boyfriend today that i have been feeling really unmotivated this semester. And he tells me, Here's the thing, I take a pill. Taking a pill is not an option for you. Have you tried forcing yourself to be motivated?. I just told him thanks. I feel hurt, but I can't explain why or if I should even feel this way. I don't know.","I feel the same way, I am single and have problems socially. So being alone makes my motivation worse and makes me really depressed. I am failing most of my classes this semester and don't seem to have motivation to make a rebound. Just know that theres people out there going through what your going through and I am here to at least give you assurance that you aren't alone in situations like this. I don't like it when people tend to say just force yourself to be motivated, but I am just lazy and hopeless at this point. I wish the best for you and I actually was on pill medication for this sort of stuff at a point, so if you got questions about that or anything in general maybe I can make use of myself and help someone out who needs it more than I do."
Anyone else scared?. Just thinking about how when I lay in bed alone I realize how scared i am of myself/ my brain.,"Yeah, but at the same time, some of us also deny that that's the reason for our unhappiness. After all, how pathetic is it to want something and be sad because we can't have it? The human condition is weird."
"I feel so sad. I feel so empty.. I know how I manage to make it through each day that passes. Somehow I make it, but all a blur.","Everything is pointless and hopeless I was born broken and forever unable to feel happiness please end me now I can't do this anymore. I had to let that out. Sorry. I hope you find meaning in your days, OP. I've given up myself, but I really, really hate to see other people feel this way. Life is so hard. I things get better and easier for you."
"Looks like we're back to waking up and feeling suicidal. Hooray, my spirit has been successfully kept broken",Yup waking up only to find everything is still gray and there's still work to be done.
i have barely been to class in 2 weeks. i feel like a fucking failure. i have classes today and i just get the motivation. i want to fail out of school. i want to have to work full time instead. i just want to do anything. i hate myself so much,I'm going through the same thing right now I can't convince my self to get ready and fix my life it sucks.
"Where does my mental illness stop and my personality begin?. I hate my depression, but at the same time I am terrified of losing it. What would be left? My current life is the result of years of untreated depression and apathy, and that is what I have always been.",Thank you. That's so relatable.
"Picked up the wrong drink at starbucks, barista sort of scolded me and I had to hold back tears. Sucks being on the brink of an emotional breakdown all day long. :( I said I was sorry.",You should think about putting in a complaint. Someone who works in customer service should know how to be nice to people especially when it was a simple mistake.
A hundred feet under water and almost out of breath.. Aka that feeling of impending doom combined with complete isolation.,i just wish there was something we all could do..
"Feeling contradictions. Does anyone else feels like sometimes people just hate and it's awful, yet there's another voice saying that no one thinks about you enough to hate you, that no one really cares?","There are people in this world who are extremely petty and evil minded. They definitely exist, in large numbers unfortunately. :( Some people *don't* have anything better to do than to mock or ridicule another person."
"I hate social media. I fucking hate facebook and snapchat, and get more lonely the more I browse them. Then just don't look at them... well I have a fear of missing out and it's such an integral part of our generation's lives...",I get how you feel. I constantly scroll though my social media feeds and realise how much of a loner I really am. Seeing everybody out partying and enjoying their great life and then me at home all alone and not one person to talk to. :(
i dont even know anymore. i know its dramatic but i just cant fit anywhere and for the 16th year of my life all i want is for it to be over to not have to deal with feeling like this anymore,Can you give a bit more of context to your description?
What's even the point?. Life has almost become just too much for me to handle..I don't know what I'm living for anymore,I'm in the same boat. Actually just took way too many pills and hope i don't wake up. If I do then I guess it's not my time. Keep your head up. Its not worth it.
Depression comes and goes for me.... I'll be having a good day and one thought ruins it all. I get pissed at a lot of things and I get angry easily...,"It's that simple, isn't it? That's exactly what makes it so wretched. Like you, I can be perfectly fine, everything going well and then, bam! I'm off the deep end with one slip of the tongue, one word, one internet scroll...one anything."
Boredom. How do you cope with boredom? Everything that I do bores me after awhile... and how do I deal with the feeling of loneliness? I never really cared that I'm usually by myself until my boyfriend defined me as a loner infront of his friend. Needless to say it hurts a lot...,sometimes it helps if a end goal or purpose. Also a pretty rude comment. You guys should talk. Hope you feel better
"What do you do to feel alive?. I vary from cutting myself, drinking and doing drugs to exercise, strict diet and hard work.","Chemically using calcium hydroxide. easy to go overboard, though. I have on several instances burned so deeply it destroyed nerve cut too, but generally stick with burns."
Anyone else dislike their mother?. Why the hell did she give birth to me?,I believe your can dislike an individual's attitude or personality or health but the being itself has no cause for dislike (aside from physical appearance)
"Do you ever question the point of your life?. I do this a lot. I've asked myself the same question a million times already. I've wondered the purpose of my life for years now, and here I am, still asking this question. I don't belong here. I can't do anything right, I just suck at everything. I would kill myself, the only thing stopping me is my family. I don't want to hurt them, neither disappoint them, but it's their fault. They are held in this delusion that I'm somehow going to do something with my life. That won't happen. I'm an incompetent worthless pile of garbage, and either they fail to see it, or they do see it, and try to convince themselves otherwise. I obviously have no chance at finding a significant other, and I sure as hell am not having kids. That would just be selfish, to risk them inheriting my shitty genes and having to live with that for their lives. I can't even express in words how much I want to die sometimes. Life is too random, and there's too much luck involved. It's just a mess of who gets the luckiest, and what they can do with what they were blessed with.","Well look, I see your confusion, but not really asking a question. not really giving yourself a chance to construct something that will give you a leg to stand on when it comes to your own consideration. asking these rhetorical questions, like, what? supposed to have kids? supposed to do something Those things are up to you, but if you find value in them then you keep looking for validation there. It sounds like trying to work backwards from what you think makes other lives worth living, what you think validates their lives. But a vexed approach. Those things may enrich a experience and situations, but they confer meaning and significance in and of a cart before the horse thing. We get value from lists of attributes, you just plug in these arbitrary conditions and get a happy human that lives an engaging life. And, more importantly, you fixate on those attributes and dream that those magical little things are what stand between you and your sense of fulfillment and worth. You have to start smaller and construct that sense of purpose and wellbeing piece by piece. You have to make little investments in your immediate world that contribute something to that."
"Took a depression nap earlier. Now I'm not tired, when I want to be",I just want to go back to sleep but I because all been doing is sleeping. a nice escape I guess
I'm a Fucking failure and I hate myself.. That's really all there is to it. I can't handle the mornings. I wake up every day desperate to die.,"I can't even be on Facebook anymore because of this. All the happy little lives while I enviously look on, suffering of course."
"Found this short poem while looking through depression comics that made me chuckle, thought I'd share. Razors pain you; Rivers are damp; Acids stain you; And drugs cause cramp. Guns aren't lawful; Nooses give; Gas smells awful; You might as well live. It's called 'Resume' by Dorothy Parker, in case you're interested.",I love this one. It's my favorite.
"So Long and Goodnight, I'm drinking myself into oblivion. I'm more than half a bottle in to shutting down my fucked up brain. Good luck to you all.","I'm sorry that you feel this way, and if it means anything I hope you wake up tomorrow and things look up a bit"
I feel so lost. I feel like I am losing myself.,I lost myself a long time ago.
I'm ready. I've been dealing with this for long enough. I'm tired of feeling sad. I'm done.,I hope you r ready to be happy and move on from this phase
"friendzone. This girl I loved friendzoned me and my depression kick in, I haven't had it in a while but it's back. It clouds my mind and impairs my thinking, ad if being intoxicated. I don't want to die but I wouldn't mind if I did. I loved her.",I'm very sorry that happened to you - I know the pain of loving someone and not having them love you back - How long have you back feeling depressed for?
i just stay at home all of the time. have a job and I have friends in real life. I feel like making me more ill and less able to be around people.,"Getting a job is pretty stressful when you're feeling down. It doesn't help that sometimes finding a job, or the right job at least, is pretty stressful itself. What I found is that volunteering is a great stepping stone on the path to getting a job and being more comfortable around people. Volunteer gigs are pretty easy to find and land, and the people who also volunteer tend to be nice people as well. If that's something interesting to you, call up your local churches and ask about volunteering opportunities. As an added bonus, volunteering work looks good on some job applications."
I can't get out of bed.. Been in bed all day. I need positive words.,It's always sunny above the clouds
There's too much. I can't fix everything :( Can't fix anything at all recently,You can't fix everything because that's impossible. No one would expect you to fix everything. You're only human ya know
I feel like I miss an old friend I never had. Sorry if that doesn't make sense that's the best way I can think of putting it,"I get it. At some point a few years ago I stopped being able to feel joy. Even when I'm feeling stable, I still don't feel *happy*. When I've described this to my therapist and psychiatrist, they challenge me on it -- you talk about good things, don't you feel happy when those happen? -- but I know the difference. It is very much like an old, lost friend. I actually might use that metaphor in therapy this week."
Fucking stupid. Fuck High Schoolers and fuck everything else,What kind of stuff do you like?
My therapist discharged me. Lol. Not even my therapist wants me.,"I've struggled with abandonment issues most of my life, my fiancee left me last year, my friends and family act like I don't exist and even though I brought that up in the one counselling session I've ever had, I still got turned down for counselling. I tried going private and still got the same result. What does it say when someone with abandonment issues gets turned away by a therapist? You can't tell someone that their therapist cares about them because you care about the kids you look after."
Alcoholism is taking over. blew my life savings on drugs before not trying to do it again. Not a lot of options at this point. Prescribed benzos for anxiety which really helps but at the same time constantly tempted to do more.. I want harder shit too but really trying to just be normal,"I always hated alcohol, but started drinking about a year ago.. I was way too drunk after two beers already, but nowadays I can down a 0,7l 16% in an hour and just feel the misery go away for a bit. I used to smoke weed, but that only made me lazier and more depressed. I now have an amphetamine addiction and recently tried meth for the first time neglecting my girlfriend, stealing from my dad just to be high alone... all to fill the void Drugs make everything worse, but sometimes I feel like they are the only things that put a little bit of excitement into my body."
I hate myself so fucking much. I don't know how to cope anymore.,Maybe someone who still loves the you that you hate.
In one week I will do it. Seven more days. I think that's enough time for me to figure out if there's any reason to live any longer. Got everything I need to do it. I feel... at peace...,"1. Are the problems you have permanent or out of your control? 2. Have you talked with all of your friends and family or a therapist? I dont know what you are going through, but whatever it is, is it really THAT bad you feel the need to end your life?? Now just think about what all your friends and family will think once you are gone... they will be blaming themselves forever because they will feel like they are at fault because they didnt help you when you needed it most. Again idk what going through, but think of how many people are going through as worse or worse than you and still tough it out and make it through."
Anybody else daydream something or somebody would just kill them?. For example crossing a road and thinking please can this car just run a red light and kill me.,"I day dream about death sometimes, but honestly I want to die but not just by myself or an accident. I want to die doing something good. I don't want my suicide to be just a loss of a life but more of a loss for a good cause. For example dieing while fighting for my country would be a good way."
Can’t do it anymore. Too much going on in my head.. I handle it. I just want this to stop.,"Can you talk about whats going on in your head? Maybe if you get it out, it will be a little more sorted? I'm sorry it's so overwhelming right now. Someone loves you, they just don't know how to show it the right way, right now."
"Maybe suicide is the answer. People say it gets better. Well, for the past four years its been getting worse. What's the point of living if there's nothing worth living for? I'm thinking of finally going through with this.","You know what kind of answer you'll get here. I know this is your state of mind right now, but realize that it is a state of mind. You want to take some kind of action to change your circumstances and right now suicide seems like the only option. That's because taking some kind of action to change your circumstances helps lift your brain out of its depression. Suddenly you don't feel completely hopeless. Maybe life can be better after all... Except you'd be having that thought as you're dying. That would be terrible. So you have to find some other way to turn things around."
Has anyone had an unanticipated nervous breakdown before? What were the warning signs?. Or did you realize it was happening from the beginning?,"Saw mine coming a mile away. Suffering from anxiety and depression, and life circumstances kept becoming more and more difficult. Job was going to shit and stressing me out. Money was becoming a bigger and bigger problem at home. Was getting very little sleep between stress and my son not sleeping at night. One day it became too much. Started crying and having a panic attack. Didn't stop until I drank myself to sleep. The next day I was still struggling to function due to feeling incredibly and persistently overwhelmed. That was three years ago"
Today's my 22nd birthday. I'm so over existing. I'm just so tired of everything. Everyone.,"What's been hurting you lately? I know birthdays can be awful when depressed, as I've had my fair share."
I want to die. Everything is too busy. Too many noises and I even keep up with my life I want to fade into nothing,&gt;3 days?! &gt; &gt;Im gonna need 3 years bruh
Anyone here suppress their emotion?. I feel like if i let myself get to emotional i might kill myself.,"People ask me why I'm zoned out most of the time. I'm not zoned out, I'm just in bot mode so I don't have to be attached to anything. It helps me supress the depressive thoughts but every night, it all just flows back in. I hate it."
"I've came to the point where I feel like sadness is my comfort state.. Just that, I really don't know how to take that idea out of my head.",Sometimes I feel like I almost like being depressed... weird huh?
I thought I was getting better. I've been in bed all day and literally haven't moved.,"Same here, big exam Tuesday and i barely read anything. Usually i could get my ass out of bed to study but this year i just can't. Maybe go take a little or long walk, been doing it for three days now and at least i don't feel like shit. Your mileage may vary, tho"
"I was basically told by two people today that I need to lose weight.. Not feeling so great about myself today. First, my psychiatrist brought it to my attention this morning that gained 20lbs and that we should discuss this. She recommended a dietitian for me to see. Then my neighbor told me that I should start running with her in the mornings because how gonna get Totally unsolicited too. I bring anything up about weight or working out. I have a hard time feeling good about myself on a good day. Today, I just want to eat my feelings.",I feel you there and I am so sorry! Those people suck!
I'm just having a really bad time right now. Anyone want to be friends and vent with each other?. Pretty much the title. Im a 19/m from the UK.,Hmu if you want to talk.
I feel like I am slowly decaying in this house all alone and no one cares. Every day is the same. No one messages me. No one cares. I have nothing.,"I feel like that everyday, my family just walks past me and says nothing. But I feel its blatant disrespect, as I could be using a light and come turn it off while using it... sucks. No one texts me, when I try to play games no wants to play. I have nothing as well, and I honestly want to go..."
"I feel like I'm underwater. I don't feel happy or sad, a little bothered but I just don't care. My limbs feel heavy and difficult to move. I don't want to move or do anything. It kind of scares me, then again that's life sometimes.","Yeah. The numbness is hard to get used to, it sucks. Sometimes it can be better than a roller coaster though."
"My life is a parade of rejections and fuck ups and I just want it to end. Happy suicide prevention day, be sure to link a list of hotlines so you can pat yourself on the back and act sanctimonious.",I get the title but not the text box. What's the deal with the hotline thing?
Anyone else feel unlovable. All i want is hugs or to cuddle with someone just to be physically/emotionally close with someone. Not just to get fucked and thrown away.,I kind of agree with you but doing all that requires an actual effort and energy. Sometimes I'm just happy to get through the day. It's a vicious cycle of being unhappy with yourself and having zero motivation to change something.
"No one wants me alive.. I just want to be cared, I'll never be cared, I'll never be liked. I'm tired of all the negativity. I'm done. Why should I be alive?",I want you to be alive! :)
Huhu. Tired of being college. Im done.,"Sorry, it's hard. I hated it."
"Kinda hope I dont wake up tomorrow. Had a fight with a friend, i was a dick.. now i cant escape this shit feeling no matter what i do. She thinks its her fault and i dunno what to do so i wanna die",Can you reach out to her and tell the same thing to her that you told here right now? I think it could help you. And her.
I wish I didn't fucking break down in public two years ago.. Now I'll always be a bitch to society. I will never really be able to live a dignified life.,Why even care what random people think of you? likely go crazy worrying about that stuff
"I just want to. get away, I want to live alone so badly",Same. Just want to get away from all the bullshit
"My parents wont allow me to sick medical assistance because they think my depression is bs. Title. I'm 16, got no money. What to do?","Ask your school counselor what resources they can give you. Just go into the office, ask for the counselor, and see what they've got."
How did you (If you did) beat depression?. I'm curious to know how y'all did it.,"I was diagnosed with moderate to severe depression while in undergrad. It's been a long journey but in essence I've gotten control of it through controlling risk factors (diet, sleep, exercise), as well as recognizing risk factors (such as social events). I've had a great support network too. There are times though that I can feel the dark clouds approaching but they're much easier to handle, and the lows are more evened out to what I guess would be considered a normal level."
"School. I start school Tuesday and all i can feel is this sense of dread of just being alone another year, but luckily its my last year. Even though its my last year i feel it's just too much to deal with. Things used to never be like this...",Good luck! Don't you have any friends in school by the way?
"I feel absolutely nothing. 3 years of being on Zoloft and i feel nothing, no emotions of anysort ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. I sometimes think i shoud be feeling a certain way in certain situations. Its really affecting my life in the way of relationships. Has anyone else had a similar experience?","Kind of like you're a walking zombie? That's why I got off it, I felt that it helped with my emotions, by completely eliminating any emotions I could feel."
"Don't give up until you're 40.. Then kill yourself if you're still where you are and nothing has changed. Or join the military. It should give you some purpose. But whilst you're still young, don't give up. Yet.",I just turned 20. 20 more years is an awfully long time. It hurts to even think it's gonna last that long.
"Writing down how I feel.. I just started writing down in a journal, everything that I am feeling and trying to make myself figure out why feeling the way I do. I know if anyone else here has tried this but I hope it helps me.",I've been trying to write a journal for the same reason. While it did seem helpful by letting me vent and understand myself better it ultimately didn't help me much so I stopped because it was very time consuming.
A lie. Maybe depression is just a lie and its my own excuse to stay weak. just dont know if depression is my problem or is it just me being weak..,I ask myself the same thing. Do I really have a mental illness or is it all a sham to justify my weak pathetic demeanor? Why do you think your weak?
"Loneliness.. Whatever that word makes you feel, let it out.","That word makes me confused. I don't understand it, so many people say they feel incredibly lonely, yet here I am, with the same sickness, not even comprehending what that weird word is supposed to mean."
"At work, feeling down,. at my second job. Which is pretty boring desk job. feeling really alone right now and stop thinking about my ex. Looking for anything to distract me","ex for a reason, right? I know hard to not dwell on what lost but imagine what you could gain without them. Your life is yours, not your let them rule it."
"Struggling. Not liking anything at all lately stressed out from work, home, family, everything is a struggle and I hate feeling so lonely","I'm sorry you're feeling lonely. Do you want to vent about any of that stuff here? I may not know what to say, but I promise I'll read it."
Why does it feel like everyone would rather be with someone else?. Haven't had a real conversation in a while.,"For me, it's because I think I'm a broken bottle of poison. All I do is hurt those around me, so I keep away both spirit and body. Those who care enough to try and help fix me end up getting hurt, and in the end, I'm still just a vial of poison. All I'm capable of doing is hurting others. I'm guessing this type of mindset sorta leaked into everything I do, so I tell myself not only do they do not want to be with me, they are better off for it."
"I'm tired of being single, but i wouldn't wish myself on anyone.. I'm fat. I'm ugly. I'm boring. And I have no redeeming qualities. I should do the world a favor and just die already.",Oh god yes. I know this feeling. There is nothing good about me. I got rejected by a guy a couple months ago that I was sure liked me too. He doesn't even know it but he made the best decision for himself. It would be the worst decision of his life if he started talking to me again. I'd feel so guilty letting somebody deal with my shit.
Day off and I have nothing to do. What are you all up to today?,Looking for people to talk to same as you
When does it get better?. I wasted the 'best years of my life' in highschool being depressed. Now I'm equally depressed in uni when I should be having even more fun partying and learning new things. What am I waiting for? Being even more depressed in an office job? It's too much..,"That whole best years of your life thing, at least in my opinion, is a load of hogwash. Best years? Body going through changes? Trying to figure out your first relationships? Stuck in school all day? Drama everywhere? Restricted in everything you want to do? Inexperienced enough to not know what you really want to do? I could go on... HS sucks. With very few exceptions, the only people I know who consider HS the best years are people who are completely and totally miserable adults who are looking back with rose-colored glasses at a time when their parents paid for everything. College is better for most people, but the partying and crap is highly overrated once you're old enough to look back a bit. I don't know anyone who misses that stuff. But what are the best years? I think once you hit your mid-20s things really start to look up. Odds are, your career is at least starting to actually materialize, you aren't as emotionally immature anymore and things don't bother you like they used to, and generally speaking the odds are that things are more stable overall. Don't sell your future short--you'll look back and realize there's a lot of crap in HS/college that you'll be glad to have behind you!!"
"Depression isn’t wanting to not exist, its more not wanting to exist feeling like this. And sometimes you just cant stop feeling like this.","I think once out of this, look back thinking I could never be happy? And enjoy those times when they last."
"It never goes away. It always runs in the background. You may be laughing with friends but it's always here. And when you think that it's finally over, it comes back worse than ever.","We have all kinds of urges, and I treat depression like that. Something to ignore most of the time, and constantly defy to prove myself that those thoughts are wrong. I have come to terms with it and am not wrestling with a monster anymore. I got him in a cage and he's my bitch. Woof. Woof"
How do I tell someone that comments like cheer up aren't helpful?. I don't want to come off rude or anything. The seems that the person cares about me. I don't want to say anything mean to them or hurt them. I just want them to know that those comments really aren't helpful.,"Tell them that you appreciate their support, but feel that you aren't sure if cheering up will help in your situation. They'll understand."
How do you feel. What is life with depression? Tell me your story,"To answer your question, I'm actually feeling alright today. Had an existential crisis last night and probably would have ended up killing myself or at the very least cutting myself if it wasn't for my dog licking my hand as I layed in bed crying myself to sleep (she's NEVER an affectionate dog, it took me a minute to even realise that she was actually licking my hand and I wasn't imagining shit). Thanks, Charlie. Anyways, for me depression is like absolute insanity. It's not just sadness or feeling like killing myself every other week. Just pure insanity. The best example I can give is probably two years ago, seventh grade. That was probably the lowest I had ever been. Every night when I went to sleep, I'd stay up on my phone. Not because I wanted to be, because it kept me from going to sleep and having the same nightmares I had every night. And then I'd look at the time, which by now was probably about 12 AM, realise how absolutely sad and pathetic I was and turn on some emo music, usually being something like Set it Off's I'll Sleep When I'm Dead and listen to that as I (literally) sadistically laugh and cry myself to sleep. Some nights, that kind of stuff never happened. I'd have a peaceful sleep. Some nights I'd stay up all night debating whether I should text the suicide hotline, doing so, and it being no help whatsoever. So I'd get, maybe six hours of sleep at most. Before I'm woken up and have to get ready for school. How am I woken up? By my parents during the best part of my dream or the most peaceful part of my nightmare. Which already started my day off terribly. Then for an hour I'd be in the bathroom once again listening to emo music as I let the shower water run. My favourite songs to listen to were usually just about anything by Hollywood Undead. Not something a twelve year old should be listening to, sure. But it was a way to cope with my depression. As I listen to those songs, once again sadistically laughing at my own pain and often times end up cutting myself. I never cut myself deep, I was far to afraid of doing that. But... I enjoyed seeing the blood come out. I didn't cut for any sort of high or release of pain. It was sort of hard to explain. I was never addicted to cutting, I could stop or start whenever I wanted. Sometimes stopping for months at a time, but seeing the blood, made me feel happy. If you could have seen my eyes, especially when I cut myself, you wouldn't have seen any traces of a twelve year old. You'd see an insane person desperately trying to grasp on to the last straw of sanity, but nothing else. Some days I'd debate whether I should do a sort of murder-suicide thing. Or at the very least murder those who have caused me pain and suffering. Sometimes I'd have very and scarily elaborate plans on how I'd trick, kidnap, or kill my family. Things that you'd never expect from a twelve year old. But quite frankly, I might have physically been twelve, but my depression had probably aged and matured me way faster. The ride to school was probably the most traumatic for me. The ride was only about ten minutes (five minutes to school, five minutes in the carpool line). But those ten minutes were full of tests streaming down my face, me punching myself or ripping my hair out, or destroying my notebooks or pencils. Sometimes because I just really didn't want to go to school. Sometimes because my social anxiety got the best of me. Sometimes for reasons I don't even know. Me and my grandma would usually sit at the front of the school for about an hour or two, I'm sitting there trying to find a way to hurt myself because I'm angry, but don't want to let my anger out on her, and she's crying because she's absolutely lost on how to help me. I'd usually end up getting to school about a good three hours late. In school, I don't remember anything. Maybe it's because I was just walking around the school like a robot. Class for an hour, find your next class, repeat. In class, I'd have my head down in a book (not paying attention to the teacher whatsoever), I'd be mindlessly reciting the emo songs I listen to in my head, or I'd be talking to my friend AIDEN. (Yes, his name is in all caps). What I do definitely remember is hating all of my peers. Hell, I still hate them. It's not my hatred for them itself. It's just I can't stand how immature, idiotic, and stupid they were. Like who the hell goes around sticking Tide pods in their mouths for views on social media? Or who thinks it's funny to go around telling people to kill themselves because you heard your favourite edgy YouTuber say it and now you think it's hilarious to do so. Or why do you think it's cool and okay to curse every five seconds and use the N-word? Or why do you think that because you saw Kim Kardashian half naked in some photo shoot that you can show up to school with hardly any clothes on or sag and talk about fucking whores because your favourite rapper said it in their newest song? Act your own god damn age, quit trying to act like someone three times your age while being as immature as a kindergartener. More on AIDEN: AIDEN sort of just appeared out of nowhere. I don't know when or why I came up with him, I just sort of did. I'm not schizophrenic, he was 100% my own voice talking back to me in my head, but I enjoyed pretending to have someone to talk to. Someone who walked around with me everyday, knew exactly what I was thinking, and could relate to me all the time. Someone who (though was just my own voice), talked me out of suicide many times back in 7th grade. But slowly I started treating AIDEN a lot more like a real person. To the point where I could have easily been mistaken as someone with schizophrenia. At home I'd just go into my room and basically lock myself in. My door was never locked, my parents could come in and out as they pleased, but I would just hand out under the covers all day. I didn't want to see light, light didn't want to see me. I didn't bother with homework. I figured, I fail, I fail. I really had just given up with life at that point. The only reason why I hadn't killed myself was probably because I was too sad and lazy to bother trying. Occasionally I'd talk to AIDEN or watch YouTube or something, but most times I ended up listening to hypnosis. Hypnosis for me was like a way to escape real life. Like meditation, but instead of being left alone with my sad and depressing thoughts, I could listen to someone else. At first it was a nice little escape, but then it more or less because an addiction. An odd strange one that I'd never be able to explain to anyone, but an addiction none the less. I'd try to listen to hypnosis any time I could even if that meant going into my room away from family to listen to it. It kind of gave me the same high that cutting, smoking, drugs, or porn give other people. Even though it was just hypnosis, it really did become unhealthy. Before I knew it, it was time for me to go to bed. And then the whole cycle would repeat itself over and over and over and over and over again. It was the same routine, same schedule, same insanity over and over again. This sounds like more is going on than just depression, right? Like some other underlying mental illness. But this is all depression and a bit of social anxiety. No MPD, no schizophrenia, no bipolar disorder, I'm not a psychopath or sociopath. This was all thanks to my depression. No one actually knew how bad my mental state was. I never told anyone. I was diagnosed with depression and put on meds, but if anyone really knew how bad it was, I likely truly would have been put in a mental health hospital. This is where the most insane part was, since being on my meds, I'm a lot more stable. But I miss being the way I was. Even though they were supposed to, my meds didn't help my depression. It really just made me more stable. Now without AIDEN or cutting myself or the enjoyment of listening to emo music as I sadistically laugh and cry at the same time, I just feel empty. Though I was completely fucked up, it was still fun a times to laugh at how much I hate myself and my life. Now I can't do those things anymore. It's like being insane was a big part of me and my depression. The insanity itself was taken away, but the depression was still left. Now there's just a big, empty, dark hole."

The loneliness literally hurts. I guess I just long for companionship so much that I feel like I'm in pain I'm so lonely. And my stupid brain won't allow me to go out and meet people because I'm so depressed. Who would want someone like this.... I can't take it.,"This is why communities like this are amazing.

It could be only worse.. Life never gets better. Try to accept it.,Your foundation needs to fall down before you can start rebuilding. Have you started the plans the blueprint?

Now I can start thinking what the fuck I need to do in order for my new building to be beautiful the way I want it. It'll take time but it's all worth it. Allow yourself to rebuild.
Satisfaction from helping others. realised that when I have to much alone time is when I start to think things over and get awful anxiety or feelings of depression. So therefore if anyone would like a chat or just someone to listen to them here,"Helping someone else is often an achievement. - Even if we don't actually help them, we go to the effort to actually do something, with effort, thought, compassion and eagerness to do good. - When everything is hard to do, because C R I P P P I N G D E P R E S S I O N, let us count very victory no matter how small it may feel. Achievements help us to feel a little less shitty - we did a thing! Yay But also when we help others we help ourselves. - We remind ourselves to be positive, we read commends and upboat new ideas, where we may even add them to our own ideology. - To learn about the struggles of others we feel indifferent which is comforting - maybe we arnt as weird and broken as we tell ourselves?

Attachment problems. I'm so sick of myself putting loads of energy into people and then they just push me to the side and forget me. But it's my problem because I get too attached but it just hurts so much,"I used to feel like that too. Now I've understood that acquaintances and friends can be won and lost overtime.

I feel like everyone will be better off without my negative energy around them. My depression relapsed after a year and its even worse this time around.,"I was getting better around last November after 2 years of being a shut in. I got a job, moved out and on with my life, and was doing good. I started to decline about 4 months ago. I'm back to where I was. I moved back. No more job. No more new friends. The only thing that keeps me going is that this right now won't be forever. It's for now and it's so debilitating. I leave my bed to use the restroom, grab something to eat back in bed, and thats it for last week at my just getting here lowest points. And over time the time spent like this will get shorter and the time spent on that high curve will go longer and farther. I don't feel that in any way. I'm lucky to have had a decade of therapy to make me feel like I know it tho. Doesn't change the feeling at all but gives me a shred of hope to hang onto. I'm really sorry you feel that way mate. Some people don't do well with that kinda energy but there are a lot who will not care too and help you with their energy. My dad is neutral and doesn't care, but can't really help. My mother won't even be around me when I'm down. Even told me she can't stand it. Just having the 2 people I have right now for when I am down tho helps me a lot.

Update: I'm feeling slightly better thanks to you guys, but it's slowly coming back again and I kept on doing on what you guys are telling me to do and I'm officially lost in the mind again help if you can.","Do your parents tell you that you're a failure? My mom and dad both did that to me for a while. I'm 16. I used to be depressed over my bad grades and I had this constant anxious feeling that my life was over because of these bad grades and I would amount to nothing. Then all of a sudden one day, I noticed that bad grades in high school aren't the end of the world. It might have been because I moved out of my Dad's place and I didn't have to hear him call me a failure anymore. Either way, I became happy again. Then I met her. A nice girl who was my age. She had a pretty face, we had a ton of classes together, and she thought I was really funny. I was able to open up to her. I think (I know) I fell in love with her. She had a boyfriend though. He's a shitty person. He's high all the time and he always flirts around with other girls. I really thought she would break it off with him and find her way to my arms and I'd be the happiest guy in the world. That didn't happen. I became desperate. I began to have a drinking problem because of it. One night while very drunk I texted her a bunch of things about my depression. I don't think she cares about me anymore. Now I find myself drunk and alone for the umpteenth time wondering how I let myself get depressed again.  Basically what I wanna say to you is: your life's not over, it's just beginning. Whatever it is that makes you feel like a failure is probably a problem that is possible to overcome. Just focus on you and don't let other people get in your way and bring you down like I did. Don't let anyone else determine your happiness. Control your life. You can do it."
"The dilemma I'm facing every day. Don't be sad and quiet, people don't like sad and quiet.

If we honestly, truly act like we feel 100% of the time, there really isn't much hope to establish any real connection to anyone.. It's really fucking difficult to wear a mask all the time, but at least it's marginally better that being alone all the time, isn't it? Most people don't want to associate with someone who is severely depressed and deathly anxious, and I can't even blame them.. If I do act like how I feel, I'm probably a nightmare to be around, because there's an aura of sadness and hopelessness that surrounds me. How can I expect anyone to approach me? Even if there is someone who does, it would be crazy to expect them to completely accept a miserable wreck like me. I mean, I can't just take and not give.. And then there's the people who act all smug and give you all that fucking moronic rose-tinted glasses shit with an air of superiority, a la /r/wowthanksimcured, and you feel even worse. It does feel like shit, but I've managed to construct separate personalities for interacting with my family and for anything job-related, because at a workplace, nobody gives a fuck if you're rotting on the inside due to over a decade of depression, anxiety, and self-hatred. So, while I wish I could agree with what you say, it's just not applicable.."
Emotionally abused people. Please tell me your stories if you feel like it. Who abused you? How it affects you? I want to prove myself that my case is not that bad and i can make it.,"I'm game and need to vent so here goes... I was verbally, physically and emotionally abused for as long as I can recall. Since you asked about emotional abuse I will focus solely on that. I was blamed constantly for everything that was wrong with the family. My mother told me this numerous times after she and my father would have huge, physically violent fights that started over events that had nothing to do with me. I was constantly told If you had a brain you would be dangerous. by my mother. Not after I'd done anything, not after a stupid act or action on my part but just in passing. This was my mother's assesment of me and she told me this frequently. I was tested, determined to have a high IQ, placed in gifted and talented classes and made to suffer for it by narcissistic, superficial, egotistical mother for my entire life. If I vot an A I was told it was because the work was too easy for me, if I got a B it was because I was lazy and never applied myself. I would constantly be accused of thinking I was So smart. Nothing I ever did or attempted to do was good enough, there was always some flaw in it. I only received criticism, never any praise. In 4th grade I had lovely long hair, my mother decided I should have it all cut off. She took me to a beauty school and had them cut all of my hair off, a boy cut, they shaved the back of my neck. My mom cried afterward and said she was crying because The haircut showed how ugly I was. The next week we were going into our small town to pick up this giant fancy framed picture for our living room, My mom made me walk on the opposite side of the street after we got out of the car. She said, I don't want to be seen with you and have people know you are my daughter. My mother really values externak beauty. I was a skinny unremarlable child, I never forgot the other side of the street incident, I had to look at the damn framed picture that we picked up that day until I moved away from home and got married at age 19. Every time I saw it I thought of that day. Years of torture. I was a divorced single mother, my ex never paid a dime, not any of the support we were supposed to receive. I worked two jobs to support us. I never received any financial help from anyone. I crafted a nice career for myself and tried to be a good mom and a good person. I never drank, never did drugs or ran around or went wild or got in any trouble. But my mother was/is ashamed of me and made/makes sure to let me know it. Anyone she talks about to me she lets me know how successful their children are, how wealthy they are and how proud the parents are. My mom told me one day how disappointed she was with how I'd turned out, how she always thought I'd be someone when I grew up. She said she'd hoped I would've grown up to marry a doctor or lawyer or someone important. I told her I was someone. At the time I was an online database adminstrator with a nationally recognized nonprofit but to my mother I was an embarrassment, a nothing and a nobody. My mother's father, my grandfather was one of the only people in my life that was always kind to me, he treated me like I was special and had value. My mother knew I adored him and she hated that he liked me. After he died she insisted on telling me horrible things about him saying she wanted me to know what kind of man the grandfather I worshipped really was and that I should not feel special that some thing like him tolerated me better than most. Right after I was divorced, I was not yet employed full time and very poor. I was visifing my parents at their huge house in the country. My mother started bitching about how poor I was, I had not asked her or dad for a dime and I was not there to eat. Mom started talking about dying, asked me if I had a sill, etc.. Mom told me I better not die because she did not want to have to spend her money on a funeral for me, and she said not that anyone would show up at a funeral for me anyway. She also told me that she'd always thought of me as a living abortion, since my birth. She was going nuts, yelling and spitting. She told me she bet I was so poor, such a failure that I probably could not even afford feminine products. I got my purse to leave, opened it and hurled a few tampons at her, as I told her, wrong bitch. My father blocked the front door, and tried to make me apologise to my mother. I had to threaten to call the police before he would let me go. After my father passed away my mother called, she said she needed to ask me something. Then mom said, Did you ever think or get the feeling that your father really loved you or cared about you? I told my mom that yes, yes I did. That dad was a fifties guy and although he may not have ever been emotionally demonstrative I thought he did love and care about me. He has worked hard and made personal sacrifices to care for us financially when I was young. That there had been a few occassions that he'd been very nice to me. Like going into a shop and buying me a top he knew I wanted for my 16th Birthday. Buying me a computer, working with me on computer projects early on, buying us both laptops, teaching me to shoot and fish, and by his having special nicknames and greetings for me, etc.. I told mom that was how dad expressed his love. My mother said, That's interesting because I always had the impression that he didn't care about you at all. I was also emotionally abused by my father, it was different than my mother's abuse though. My dad alwsys had to be the best. He could not stand for me to be good at anything I could never, ever be as good as he was or (god fobid it) better. My parents were never involved in our education. They basically just asked us at dinner how school was and we'd say OK and dinner would proceed. I should have known from past events not to dare say anything positive had happened but one day I was happy and excited about something that had happened at school, in English class. I was so excited that I stupidly spoke up at dinner. When the standard, How was school? question was asked I boldly said, School was great, Mrs. G, my English teacher pulled me aside after class. She told me a poem I'd written for an assignment was so good they want my permission to publish it on the first page of the student yearbook! My father put his fork down, he tilted his head, gave me a bizarre look and told me to recite the poem. I could not recite it, I was too nervous and afraid. I said I would show it to him after dinner, it was no big deal. No, dad wanted to hear this fabulous poem I had written, right then. I went and got the poem and started to read it out loud. Dad told me to give it to him to read. He told me if it was in the yearbook people woukd be reading it for themselves. Dad read it silently and then while scoffing and half laughing he read it aloud. Dad asked me if the idiots at my school really thought that was good writing? He said he bet he could write something right then that would be a hundred times better. Dad left the table and went to his desk while we all sat at the table waiting for his return. After about twenty minutes Dad cheerfully returned, poem in hand. He stood and read it to us. It was some lame poem with Brother can you spare me a dime as one of the lines. Dad then told us, See, that's a poem, that's what good poetry is like! After that he asked all of us, Wasn't my poem better, a lot better? We all agreed, and lied and said his poem was a lot better. I told the English teacher not to let them use my poem for the yearbook. I never wrote another poem or much else for that matter. That crap happened in 1975 and I am still not over it despite counseling. Another thing that was a form of emotional abuse was the family hierarchy. My father came first, then my sister or mother, then me. I.always came last, even though I was the eldest child. There was this thing with the food. If we had any serving size type of meat it came into play. Let's say it is steaks for dinner, they are on a platter. The largest steak is for Dad, younger sister gets the next largest, mom third largest and smallest was for me. It was like that with all of the food. It was an unwritten rule. I decided to challenge it once when the platter of Hamburgers was beside me. I knew better than to go for the one for Dad but tried to take the secind largest one. My mom was immediately shrieking at me, No, no, put that back, it's for your sister! Yours is the small one. My parents home has our family pictures hanging in the study, they are hung vertically on one wall. The order is from top to bottom, a picture of my dad, a picture of my mom, a picture of my sister, a picture of my son, then a picture of me. I.am at the very bottom, like always. I.endured physical, emotional and mental abuse. I've seen therapist on occasion over the years and at one point was in therapy sessions twice a week for a year. It helped but it hasn't enabled me forget. I just have to deal with what happened and move forward. I'm not social, I don't really trust anyone or have any close friends but I'm okay with that. TLDR: Emotionally abused, made me tough, I survived it with a bit of therapy. Edit: Added TLDR"
I don't feel important. I feel like I'm marginalized and unimportant. I could disappear and truthfully no one would notice or care. There's nothing about me that's lasting or important about me that comes from me and me alone. I just don't matter.,"It's an interesting thing. You have to feel that you're important regardless of what anybody feels at least that was the message that people gave to me (non verbal). I mean, when I was in HS I didn't feel important. I didn't have any friends or relationships and I thought me not finding work in HS was the main cause of that. These days, I have a job and i'm in college working on a STEM degree...Still no friends or relationships...not even a sign that anyone is interested. I have to find importance in myself first and I come before everyone period because there is a good chance that I will die before anybody chooses to realize that I exist."
.... He abandoned me when I needed him the most.,Hope you're alright. Try and move on as fast as possible and keep this in the back of your head so you don't fall into a dangerous rebound. Keep your head up.
Why should I stay?. Whats the point? Who really gives a fuck? Nobody...none of you people look at me ...none of you see me for who i could be. Why should i stay... got 15 mins to save a life..and go,"Because there'll be better days. I know you what you think. That it's bs but it's true. I've fallen so hard yet sooner or later there's that one thing happening and then it gets better. If you off yourself now think about all the things you couldn't expirience? Your first kiss, playing with your child, true love, a beautiful landscape that you maybe planned on visiting, the smell of rain, the taste of your favorite food, that awesome feeling of completing a task and it goes on and on. I know how you feel. I didnt believe it either but it's true. It may take years to come but there'll be a moment later where'll you say im happy that i didnt kill myself"
I don't know what's wrong with me. What should I do?. I don't know why anyone would love me. I don't even like myself. I was having an emotional breakdown about something earlier and my boyfriend tried calming me down. He tried holding/hugging me but I told him to get away from me and said that he doesn't love me and that he's only with me until he finds someone else. He grabbed me and told me that I'm beautiful and that he loves me and that I'm his heart. I continued tried to push him off of me but he just kept holding me tighter. He led me to the bedroom and we laid on the bed and he held me until I fell asleep. When I got up he asked me if I was okay and I told him yes. He asked are you sure and I got annoyed and screamed yes at him. Why am I the way that I am?,"It's called genetics, I would suggest seeing a doctor, but but why the hell should you listen to me? I resisted getting help till it nearly costed me my life, other people would just rather kill themselves than accept that they have problems so why should I think you're any different?"
Have anti-depressants worked for anyone?. Curious to know peoples experiences with anti-depressants. Thanks,"I have been on a few different types of SSRIs over the past few years and the only one that has worked for me so far is my current one, Fluoxetine (UK name, not sure of alternative names). It's great for my anxiety and have only been on 20mg since I started taking it, haven't had any side affects or problems with it at all. It's taken 5 years of diagnosed depression to find one that works for me, so unfortunately it's trial and error."
"I'm crying. I'm not feeling good, I just want to be dead or disappear.","What would make you feel better, do you know?"
"I don't want to die, but I don't want to live either.. Is there anything I can do?","Find a reason to die or find a reason to live. While the first option seems easier, I am hoping you could go for the second one, albeit it is much harder."
"First Night W/O My Doggo. I know this sounds silly, but this is going to be the first night spend without my baby since I adopted her in December. been my little rock. upset, and I just wanted to put it out there. scared going to slip into an episode, and by myself.","Ahw im so sorry for you, what happened to your dog if i may ask?"
"I don’t think people love me. They love versions of me I have spun for them, versions of me they have construed in their minds. The easy versions of me, the easy parts of me to love.. But no one will ever love me",What really gets me is I feel like no matter how good friends or how much someone loves you they use you something and if they using you for something they associating with you.
Actual shower thoughts. I am worthless... *sobs* *more sobbing*,Everyone has value. Everyone. What's making you feel so worthless right now?
do you avoid making decisions when you're depressed?. Knowing that your ability to make informed and clear decisions may be clouded by your depression. Do you put them off for times that you're feeling not as depressed? Kind of a make hay while the sun shines kind of thinking.,"I do this involuntarily, and it can get bad, fast. I freeze when it becomes severe; I start running scenarios in my head and I get anxious considering the possibilities. It might be that the outcome in either case is equally good, or I feel underinformed about the possibilities of one case, or what I really know I want to do has a potential worst-case that seems way more likely than it really is because I can't process over my own internal noise, but whatever it is, I just go essentially blank while my brain feels too broken to work it out. If I could undo just this one phenomenon, I could probably live with my depression a lot more easily. **Tl;dr:** right there with ya, OP."
"How do you find a good psychiatrist?. I had one I really liked when I was on my parents insurance, but the past three I've had have been bad for different reasons. Is there a site or something with reviews? What should I even look for?",I guess that depends on your country and social security system... But a phonebook will probably Work! :)
I hate myself. I hate myself I hate myself I hate myself,Same.. no place for me in this world.
My bf told me to cheer up because my life is not that hard. I have never been so close to hitting another person. It made me so angry that he said that to me.,"Dude. This feeling, I know it, and sadly, this is a common go-to response for a lot of people who simply have nothing better to contribute. It's out of context and beside the point in essence. It's a variation of the ever popular At least you aren't a starving kid in [insert country here]! and more generally It could be worse! Like, yes, thanks very much Captain Obvious, everything is relative, but that's beside the point? It's invalidating, insensitive and snobby, at best, and I have no idea if it helps you feel any better, but when a lot of people say it, they do think they're doing some genuine good to help you feel better, despite being wildly misinformed on how hurtful that phrase actually is. My boyfriend said this to me more frequently in the past and after YEARS of explaining why this is not a good response, he's slowly using it less, but when it pops up, my typical counter is That does not help me/make me feel better at all, and that typically shuts him up or at least makes him think about what he just said. In any case, I'm sorry you had that shitty non-reason response thrown at you. What you're going through is real and valid, even if others choose not to acknowledge it."
"Haven't had a genuine hug in years. It wouldn't fix anything, but it'd sure help a lot.",I haven't had human affection for 16years.
"Plz help me... ... I'm tired of living, I just wanna die",Tell us a bit more. What's your story?
"I wish i had a partner. Someone to love, and to love me back. It would not solve everything, but it'd make me a lot happier. I know i know, i'm being a little bit entitled for this. But damn, it would be good to have a partner.","I know the feeling. I had a girlfriend until May of this year, and part of me regrets breaking up with her even though we weren't meant for each other. Part of me wants to be in a relationship, and the other part thinks it would be a terrible idea and that I should be alone for the rest of my life. Admittedly, it is partly just because I'm lonely, which isn't a great thing for me to build a relationship on."
I miss you.. So much. Constantly. I just want you back.,Uhhh... who? Sorry I can't help you very much...
I dream of suicide. It's all I can think about at the moment.,I had a dream a while back that someone had a gun pointed to my head and I told them to to pull the trigger because they would be doing me a favor.....
"I can't figure out what's going on right now...am I just unlucky?. So I've been dealing with terrible apathy and overall lack of interest with things such as school lately. I don't know if my medicines are working but it's been really difficult to get out of bed and make it to class lately. It's reached a point wherein it becomes so overcoming that I feel so powerless. I have little to no focus when it comes to schoolwork. To add to that, I injured myself recently and it requires surgery. I'm a pretty active athlete and the fact that I won't be able to be as active as I want to be scares me. It hasn't really sunken in yet but there's a certain feeling of emptiness that I feel and I don't know what to do.","It's certainly possible your injury could have triggered a depressive episode, especially if it's impacting something you care a lot about doing. Or a possible side effect of a new medication? Like, I was given Vicodin after a medical procedure a couple years ago but I had to stop taking it because it mostly just made me feel groggy and withdrawn."
"wish I were dead :(. About 19 years ago, I tried to kill myself by swallowing 31 extra strength sleeping pills - and I had an amazing spiritual experience. So now I know that killing myself will just make it worse and that I can't die until God takes me himself. That doesn't stop me from wishing I were dead. I recently saw a doctor because I had some throat cancer symptoms. Unfortunately I didn't. My soul feels like it was stabbed multiple times. The thought of maybe having to live 30-40 more years is the worst feeling I have ever had since the hours before my suicide attempt. :(","It isn't easy to deal with feelings of wishing we were dead, somehow escaping this world will resolve our matters. I tried taking my life multiple times as a teenager and always felt neglected and still do. Not a day goes by where I don't think how the world and people around me would be different if I was gone, either for better or for worse. I always try to remind myself that I keep myself on this planet to make the world a better place than I left it, as much as I want to leave the world right now, I fear we would just be losing to the enemy."
"Does anyone else have insomnia?. I notice that on my worse days (of course every day sucks but you get what I mean) I find it very hard to get to sleep, I was just wondering if this is something anyone else experiences.","No, that's what I'm doing and it isn't working."
"Please let me die. Please let me fucking die and be done with this. I genuinely feel nothing, ever. I just understand why here. Every single day hurts. Please let me die",Do you want to tslk to someone? I know this feeling really well.
Lonely.. I feel really really lonely after my ex gf left me for the second time cause she wanna handle my mental state. Can I have some company pls?,Very sorry to hear it. She came back the first time?
"Has anyone here gotten better and stayed better?. As far as I've been able to tell, no matter if you get better or not, depression will always just come back. Temporary problem, my ass.","This stuff all exists on a spectrum, so maybe arriving at some place of being totally better is not what it seems. I've had hardcore depression for many years, but I have definitely moved the bar significantly (without meds and without getting what i want in life or something, like a great relationship) which I can confirm especially in the moments when my external circumstances are going terribly, but i dont fall into 6 months of suicidal morbidity. I see depression (speaking only for myself here) as a product of thoughts and meanings. The same thing can happen to two people, and a depressed person will give it an incredibly dark meaning, whereas a non depressed person might give it a neutral or positive one. To me, growth out of depression is when you are finally grasping the arbitrary nature of meaning, and the impersonal nature of thought, and can start to make conscious rather than automatic decisions about what kind of meanings and thoughts you feed and go with (even arbitrarily). So, I arbitrarily decide to look at failing as good, because it gives me good reference experiences, rather than as evidence that i am worthless. Things like that. I still struggle a lot, but there is overwhelming evidence that you can slowly climb out of the hole with very hard inner work, and that the things that would have previously sent you down the spiral become more like non issues. Meditation is the single most powerful tool i've found."
"i didn't do it. last night the urge to self harm was incredible, it was as hard as ever... I didn't do it. if I could, you can. stay strong everybody, I care about each and all of you. We're imperfect, but that's perfection.",I'm very proud of you too! Remember the great feeling of success you have right now it will help you next time you have the urge.
I hate myself so much that I'd rather not commit suicide just to punish myself. I'm dead on the inside.,what's up? feel free to PM
Right now. The pain of existence is getting too much. I'm not going to do anything permanent about it but I just fucking wish I could stop the pain. Why is it so hard to keep going.,"It is. It's very tough to keep going. I can't tell you how to make it stop, I wish I could. I just try to focus on the next very small thing I can do. I'm sorry dude. You aren't alone, I promise."
"I guess I can never drink. There hasn't been a time where I've gotten drunk, and haven't thought heavily about milling myself. I used to think about it sober but I'm past that.","Are you alright? I know dealing with this shit is a bitch, but trust me...you aren't alone. I know I'm just a stranger on the internet, but I'm here if you need to talk."
You deserve to feel okay.. You deserve to feel good.,Thank you but right now I feel like I only deserve to die.
Existing feels like trying to take every breath through a coffee stirrer.. So much effort for so little payoff,Yeah kinda. Hopefully we can upgrade to a real straw someday.
"I recently got diagnosed w depression coupled w PTSD &amp; anxiety and I've been put on Mirtazapine. Any experiences w dis drug, side-effects, withdrawals?. I just feel like it gives me a mellow weed high, actually enjoying it. Hope it treats my depression",Mirtazapine makes me incredibly sleepy. I take it about an hour before I want to sleep and be out like a light by then.
"Fml. Coming exams, presentations, rosacea skin condition which is fucking up my life. Bad grades because I have no motivation. Can't even bother to type more because life feels so worthless","Yeah, I just took my midterms and it's worst I've ever done on any group of tests. It sucks because I feel like even if I studied way more it wouldn't have made a difference. What kind of exams do you have going on?"
Happy happy. Its nice knowing that theres a place where u can just say your problems and get some nice replies. I know that some are just obligatory get well soon comments but i feel really happy whenever i see someone reply it makes me feel loved,"Same here, nice to know that not alone. I have no friends at school, I hate school to be honest, it makes me feel so depressed and lonely. My home much better because my mother is always mean, my father very kind either. This place has made me meet a bunch of people I can relate to. so nice to talk to someone who understands, it makes you feel less lonely, a great feeling."
"i have no friends. no friends, failed with girls many times, sometimes I think the world would be better off without me",I'm a little lite in that area too.
"Wife is considering suicide.. My wife has a long history with depression, dating back to her childhood. She's tried to do it before and someone found her. I need to know the steps to get her help.",Get her to a doctor and get her to tell them about it. They'll know what services are available to help her out.
i want die. i will probably give myself the die soon idk,or you can just waste your life instead
"How do I explain to my father that I struggle with doing basic tasks due to my depression?. No matter how I explain it, he doesn't get it","I struggle with the same thing, but with my step dad. I've basically given up on it."
Anyone else on here in their twenties and never been employed?. I'm pretty sure this is not a really common thing... And it sure is debilitating. Makes me feel like a totally lost cause.,No real job. I've have cash in hand stuff. Last job looked promising but I said I didn't want to do cash anymore as it's illegal and they didn't call me back at all.
"I feel fine during the day, but in the evening depression hits me hard. Can anyone relate? I feel pretty fine during the day, probably because I'm occupied doing stuff but in the evening I get really sad, like really sad and I also feel trapped and lonely...","Absolutely. Self doubt, drifting thoughts, bleak view of the future, and a tsunami of regret floods my mind regularly every evening. Then I retreat to the Internet which keeps me up all night. It's a little out there, but I've had incredible relief from my insomnia, depression, and chronic pain using an Aerial Yoga Hammock. I hang it from the ceiling right next to my bed/computer desk and usually just cacoon in it for an hour or so. Feeling weightless and swaying back and forth has an incredibly natural calming effect on the mind. They are only $60 on amazon too. Feel better my friend, you are not alone."
"Depression is like a parasite.. It feeds off my body to live. It lives a life; controlling mine, while I live none.","But also the majority of parasites are not pathogenic and relatively harmless to humans. A parasite such as a tapeworm for example cannot take enough nutrition from a person to drastically physically harm them. How do we get rid of parasites? Medical help is usually necessary - if it is available I would recommend it, I know it may be daunting but it could really help. There are also other options - try and find coping methods that work for you, and there is always support here and someone to talk to; feel free to send me a PM if you ever want. Keep holding on friend."
"Self Harm Habit. My anxiety and depression has gotten out of control lately. The only way I can breath is when I turn to cutting. I want to kill myself but sometimes relaxing just to watch myself bleed. Gosh, that sounds so fucked up.",Is it the feeling or the visual that eases you?
I hope reincarnation is a thing.. There's so many other kinds of people I'd rather be.,All I want and need after I move on from this life is to be Omnipotent. It's something I obsess over because I want to experience true freedom and true peace for eternity! I just want to be a God and play in my own sandbox.
"People often say depression is emotional numbness, but I find it's more accurate for me to call it emotional constipation.. It's crude, I know, but really quite accurate. I find that my emotions build up, but there's never an outlet, and the more pressure I put or the more emotionally affected I should be, the harder it is to have any emotional output. It continues until something frees up and becomes loose - usually something small that slips through the cracks. At that point, the floodgates open - I get freed up to feel more strongly, usually with explosive effects. By contrast, less depressive days are the days where I'm emotionally loose enough to function - my feeling machine has been well oiled.",Seems accurate. I just had a horrible day where the floodgates burst due to all the stuff that was building up the past few weeks that I couldn't let out.
"Lying in my bed at 2pm, too tired to do anything. My mother is pounding on the door and screaming at me because I am so worthless.. I just want to fucking kill myself. Wish I wasn't such a coward. edit: I really fucking hope I will get over myself and do it today.",Disability resources has made college much more doable for me. Please seek them.
At a friends having a drink. They're all having fun. I'm sitting here depressed.,"I can't socialize at all when I'm sober either, it sucks :/"
one question. I'll keep it simple. Can there be happiness in despair? Because I think I felt it and I want to kill off any hope that's left for me.,"That's a pretty profound question, but I think happiness is something that a lot of people don't understand. In a period or prolonged period of despair, I don't believe there can be happiness at all, and it's only after that period has been solved, over, attacked enough by effort and time, that you can start experiencing happiness. I don't think happiness and gratitude should be forced, or you should try to feel happy when you truly cannot feel happy. I'm still going through that period, and there might be rivets or jewels of happiness along the way, but they are fleeting and leave very quickly. The whole reason why people despair is because they are tied so strongly to negative emotional memories that they outweigh any trivial positive emotional memories. Think about it, which memories are the quickest, strongest, and most easily able to be remembered for you? The most emotional ones. If your most emotional memories are negative, you will be in despair. On the converse, if one's most emotional memories are positive, you will be in a state of happiness. There is a way to end your despair, you just have to face it head on and let go of everything, and keep trying to let go and accept. Very few people have any science on this and might be the thing we need to explore the most as a society as a whole."
"i know what i have to do to get better; however, i don’t have the motivation nor concentration to do it. anybody in the same boat?:(","No, because I don't know what I can do to make it better. Although the motivation and concentration doesn't help."
Weight loss and pills. Anyone lose weight from their depression pills? Don't want to gain weight from pills.,never lost weight from the medications but some are known to cause little to no weight gain. Stay away for the older class of antidepressants because the cause heavy weight gain. Avoid SSRIs and try to stick to SNRIs. Bupropion is the only med linked to weight loss. Medications such as Viibryd and Pristiq have little little no side effects of weight loss.
How do i get smarter. And also stop cutting in my sadness and anger,"Pick something you're interested in. Anything. It could be comics, a historical event, a tv show, law, place, a band, etc and learn everything you an about that topic. See where it takes you :)"
What is happiness?. always found it difficult to be happy. What makes you happy? What made you realise it was the thing that made you happy?,"true happiness is, for me, is acceptance of how sad the world is and knowing that you're truly making it better for the people in your reach. Making it better for your loved ones and friends and that includes yourself. Don't think i could ever be 100% happy, that's just being naive."
"Does anyone else bite their hands?. Like, the pain makes me forget my depression for a second.","I bite on my tongue for that reason. No risk of hurting yourself seriously if you pay attention, just hurts"
"I grabbed a piece of paper and decided to write down the names of every person who cared about me. In the end, it was a beautifully blank piece of paper.",You would have to be a horrible person to not deserve being liked.
"Cold showers. They really help. Especially when i take 2-3 showers a day, i feel relieved.",i'm certain there's a science behind the calmness i feel in water. i've heard things about flowing water making people with anxiety feel better and i often notice it myself.
I opened up to a friend. And lost them because I was too much.,You aren't too much they are just assholes for leaving you. its horrible for them to just leave you when you are struggling because they don't feel like being supportive. You will find friends who care. Sometimes friends come out and tell you that you can talk to them about anything you just need to find the right people.
Dark view on life?. I seem to find myself just having a general hatred for humanity and the way things work. I feel that my look on life as a whole is just dark when compared to most people. Anyone else feel this way? Any way to fix this?,"god damn i honestly feel the exact same as you in every aspect. sometimes i also just sit back and think about how none of this feels real, then the suicidal thoughts come on because i feel like there has to be more, then more sad, more depersonalized, and its just a vicious cycle. nothing matters, but we should at least live to the fullest, because in relative terms it matters. no idea how to do that though"
I'm not okay and I'm not going to be okay.. I've never been okay before. It's all pointless.,"Sometimes, I feel like this is okay though. The not being okay. I think there's this expectation we all have just because everyone else and everything around us shows this picture perfect life that is normal. Also, I get to the opinion sometimes that when none of it matters, it's actually the most liberating, because then I am truly free of my worldly concerns. I don't know. Silver lining and framing and all that jazz. Best of luck, friend."
"The alcohol doesn't work anymore, the girls make me feel more alone than before, all the drugs make me feel sick and sore, I've been tired since 2004, and I just want to go home.. Not really sure where that is though...",You got sick rhymes tho
Feeling Numb. Title really says it all. Just feeling numb everyday and I don't care about really anything. And when I do feel happiness (which is rare) it's just for a brief moments. Idk what to really do at this point tbh.,Have you considered speaking with a therapist? Do you know why you feel this way?

"If she marries him, I will die of jealousy.. I know it's foolish, but I can't stop this feeling. I should have told her so many years ago, when they had just met. But I thought I was taking the higher ground by keeping silent and backing off. All I did was hurt myself.","Thought I should write something since the posts you were getting didn't look helpful. It is hard not to kick yourself when you feel that you never took a chance to be with someone you thought was the one, especially when you consider them to be such a great person. I mean, how can people not blame it all oneself if the other person is what we see as nothing but good? It is points in our life like these that we carry with us that tend to weigh us down in life, these moments of regret that can build up over time that we can't move forward."
"I made a friend today. I'm making progress guys, I feel really good.","That is great, keep feeling good!"
It's so depressing to know that I have an ADHD. Do I really need to accept the fact that I am different among others? Should I be ashamed of myself?. the title says it all,"Heya buddy, i can relate, After 18 years of struggling I finally found out I have dyslexia, fine motor control issues and short term memory loss. It was like I had been designed to be the perfect malfunction so I cant do academics. I am different but I'd rather be dead then looked down upon by some other idiot who can do things I can't. I can do something better then they can, know how to go through hard times and keep pushing. When life gets hard for them they will break, and I won't be there to help them. Don't worry about other people, they will become dust while you will become a diamond. My question to you is, how are you going to move forward?"

"Does it ever end?. Serious question, does depression ever go away? I've only been going through this for roughly 2 months but I don't know if I can do this for the rest of my life.","not really, people just say it does, as they want you to stay alive because theyre selfish"
Why do I have to be Born in this shit life.. I didnt ask for it.,you just happen to be. get as much joy as you can.
"I Have Friends, But They Always Care More About Others. like that one guy everybody calls when available. It sucks and feels bad, cause when I call one of them they give a shit.","I can relate. Been a third wheel in many friendships, always feels like I'm someone people hang around instead of hang with. I even had a friend invite me over and told me he called everyone else first, but nobody was free, so guess it was time to call me. I know he didn't mean it that way, but what a shitty thing to say. Everyone else more important than you was busy, so you (bottom of the list) will have to do. It hurts and depression makes it hurt x100. Gotta find a way to prove to yourself that you are worth spending time with. I'm struggling with this pretty badly too so I wish you the best."

"If I get caught will I end up in a psych ward?. I'm planning on killing myself and was wondering if i somehow survived,would i get put in a psych ward for the rest of my life?","Depends what you mean by get caught. Someone would have to report it to police to move you anywhere or if you're under 18 parents can take you to a hospital. Basic detainment is 72 hours (3 days) To ensure you're not a harm to yourself or others. During that time they examine you and see your mental state. If at the end you're not showing signs of danger you are released but given options to stay for further treatment. If you are still a danger you stay and get more treatment. Now say you made an attempt and go to the ER for something, they can't always just detain you. I've been to the ER for atempt of suicide by oversosing on medication. Longest I was there was a few hours. Due to my mental state being stable they had no legal way to hold me loner than I wanted to be there. I got the drugs out of my system then was discharged and went home. There is a ton, a shit ton of misinformation and propaganda around mental illness. Be informed, do real research. isn't google. You are smart enough to do real research don't just ask strangers online for all the answers. Also get help."
Why am I so fucked up?. I just bombed my bio test and ruined my whole quarter. I went into the bathroom and purged my breakfast out. Now I'm crying in the bathroom floor in the school and Idk what the fuck to do next.,"Talk to your teacher. Sometimes they're willing to give extra credit if you do additional assignments or labs. Also, many teachers will at least pass a student if the student goes to them and shows that they're really making an effort in the class. One test will not ruin your life. I promise. :)"
"I feel like I’m an inconvenience or a nuisance to people, and I am not genuinely wanted.. And for that reason, this world would be better off without me. not suicidal, but if something were to completely accidentally kill me, then sure a lot of people would be relieved to be rid of this unwanted individual (me).",I feel like there might just be an in-between as well. Where someone might not care about you much but not mind being with you some/most of the time. Or is this a neutral-positive perspective?
I don't know anymore. I feel so empty that this is all I can explain,That's a familiar feeling. Talk it out. What's up?
"How do you handle people that pray on your depression/anxiety?. Sadly, I have friends that pray on my depression/anxiety. There's always something to disagree with or some snide comment to make. How do you guys cope with this? It makes me really anxious, which just leads to anger.","Here is the thing. If you open up to these people and they through it in your face right after, then you know they aren't real friends. A real friend is willing to sit through peoples problems for hours. I once sat and chatted with a friend about his issues for some 7 odd hours hours just talking till 7am, never gave up on the conversation, he did the same for me a while later down the road when I was having problems. People who aren't willing to talk to you and help you aren't worth keeping around. Believe me there is a friend out there who is willing to listen. I guess do keep in mind that not everyone has infinite patients and has their own problems. good luck out there man hope things go well for you. (This isn't to say you can't have acquaintances, people you hang out with, but never get deep)"
"You ever so sad you can't even masturbate?. Because I feel this exact way, I'm just absolutely repulsed by anything to do with sex right now.",Or play video games or eat or smile or think coherent thoughts or think of reality as real. Depression can really sap the life out of you and is really hard to communicate to someone who has not experienced it.
I need a hug. I fucked up so bad. Thinking about ending it for once and for all. I could really use a hug right now,"*hug* Whatever the situation is that's causing you to feel this way, please remember to exercise compassion towards yourself."
"does anyone else keep forgetting stuff the need to do?. like I'm always forgetting things I need to do, like taking my medicine or even putting out the trash. it seems like my brain doesn't even care about anything anymore.","All day, every day. It's definitely not just you. &lt;3"
What does depression feel like?. Honest question what does depression feel like or is it different for everyone?,like being stuck in a black hole. At times you just close your eyes and fall. Other times you open your eyes. Your eyes adjust to the darkness you realize your in a room and the door is only 3ft away it seems impossible to reach so you close your eyes and keep falling
I'm to scared to commit suicide.. All I can feel is pain. Nothing matters to me anymore and life is a miserable struggle. I don't want to live anymore but I can't bring my self to commit suicide. I'm scared of missing out on a potentially better life. Please help,"I probably would have considered bringing harm to myself and others if not for writing. Do you write? I find it helpful to seal away any self-detrimental desires inside characters who are not me. If you purge all of your thoughts out of your head and onto the page, you might find some relief. Literature is one of the most important inventions for resolving issues and you may find purpose through writing for yourself. My life is not pleasant by any means so I created the life that I want in my writing. My life became better through writing. What ideas and notions could be lost if you left us so soon? What adventures could you go on in your own book? Think of all the memories that could be shared. You could even write about a role-model. Mine is Typhon, the Greek dragon under the mountain. I obsess over this mad titan to keep myself calm. He shows up in all of my work. My advice would be to pound that pain out into a character, a mighty simulacrum, an indestructible artifact to contain your every fear. I'm not sure if I'm phrasing this well enough to help, but this is the only way I know how to express myself."
"I just want to disappear but I don't want to hurt my family. All i ever am is in the background and I feel like I'm barely noticed in this world, I'm pretty sure if I just disappeared one day no one would notice or care, I'm bored of life, I'm tired of this endless cycle of depression, I don't think I can take much more. I just need to get that off my chest thank you",People barely notice me too
"26 year old male, living at home, low income job, in school (parents paying for it), want to get married to girlfriend who graduates with nursing degree in 5 months. I feel like a deadbeat","I see what you mean, but imagine being 26, living at home with no job, absolutely no way to pay for school, and no girlfriend? I'm 26 with a decent job and live alone with no girlfriend. I tell myself that it's because I don't have a license due to a seizure disorder that I'm striking out with girls, which is probably true is some cases but I can't even see that girl being in one relationship for the rest of her life if she's picky like that."
