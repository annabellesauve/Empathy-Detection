Help. Help me. I dunno what I'm doing anymore,"That's pretty vague, do you not know what you're doing in regards to a specific section of your life? Like school or work?"
I'm done saying I love you to her because I don't want to hear a lie back to me. I feel so ugly and unwanted and unloved,"idk what a Red pill means exactly but my advice to you is if she treating you right then fuck her there are billions of other girls out there, and if u feel like in love with her and just leave her then try to not care and you have to accept the fact that some girls(as well as some guys) will lie straight to your face for years without any remorse. my advice is stop caring before too late."
Always feel like I'm being criticized and mocked even when alone.... Does anyone else experience this?,"I think it's social anxiety , that creates paranoid feelings , unless I'm wrong but that's how I feel"
"My diet becomes fucked when i get depressed.. I can't control myself in the grocery store when I'm feeling down. Chips, cookies, soda, cake, you name It. Anyone else a stress eater?","By any chance do you think you're in a loop. Junk food can make you depressed. And being depressed probably makes you eat more junk food? For a while that was my problem too. Even if its just random, ill probably binge and feel bad later. Only to indulge in more later to try to cheer up."
"I hate not knowing why. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 14. That's almost 4 years ago and I still don't know why I am like this. I have more than enough, yet there are moments where I feel like there's no hope nor a bright future waiting for me. I feel alone and abandoned even though I have friends who know that I am depressed and am like this sometimes.  I get so frustrated when I can't find out why I just can't be normal. Everything was alright about 2 hours ago, but it just changes so quickly and hard that I almost feel suicidal.  I'm a fucking mess...","depression. not sadness which is caused by something and is healthy. Depression is an actual mental disorder which commonly goes untreated. The best things you can do for depression is first of all, not hiding it, tell your loved ones so they can help you. also get a therapist, very helpful and help you cope with depression and get over it. If you think really bad you can see a doctor and see if medication is a good idea. I take antidepressants and my depression is gone, it change you like I originally thought it would, it just makes me the same but not sad all the time."
"Not arsed with school. Can't study or do homework.. My family is in a bad way right now and I'm in a bad way, mentally. I just can't care about school anymore. Feels hopeless",That's why I'm repeating 11th grade. It sucks.
"My parents wont allow me to sick medical assistance because they think my depression is bs. Title. I'm 16, got no money. What to do?","Ask your school counselor what resources they can give you. Just go into the office, ask for the counselor, and see what they've got."
"I called in sick to work today. For the first time in a couple months I was feeling so Shitty I called into both my jobs today. Just feeling too burnt out, but I slept a lot, read quite a bit and finally managed to shower so the day a complete waste",Is that really so bad? Maybe it was the smart decision because you needed that time to read recover. You're being kind to yourself when you need it and that's important. Hope you feel better soon.
"Lost my job, have no reason to live. My career is over, my personal relationships are barely existent, and the friends I do have live far away.   I have absolutely no reason to live, no job prospects, no way to afford treatment.  I will be killing myself soon unless a miracle happens.",Why can't you get a job as a lawyer?
"i wanna jump from an elevated place. i wanna kill myself, like really really would like to jump off an elevated place, but not die what do i do? drugs? fall from somewhere not far above the ground(like a 4meters jump)? you know, i'd just like to die but i have a gr8 life other than that (I have different lives in two different countries, just want to kill myself in one)","I don't want you to jump. I don't want you to die, in either one. I don't know exactly what you're going through but from the sounds of it, I'd suggest focusing on the parts in your life that you enjoy."
Wrong diagnosis-ADHD vs Bipolar Depression. For the past 5 years I've dealt with being misdiagnosed. I have ADHD and Depression but was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder. Has anyone else had this happen? What were the ramifications? How did you handle and what actions did you take?,"It's not uncommon. Bipolar can be very difficult to diagnose. We tend to think of it as a constant swinging between high and low but really you can be low all the time and still be bipolar if you had one high at some point. What you do is move forward with your new diagnosis and work on treatment and coping skills. ADHD and depression are generally easier to manage long term than bipolar disorder, so that's a plus."
How long is this going to go for?. I wish I fucking knew. Fuck you and everyone else.,Expecting people to stop being depressed like turning off a light is extremely stupid.
"I've had a hard time going back to school. Going back to school has been difficult for me, It's been around five years since I've been in a class room and I ask the teachers and the people that I go to my classes to cut me some slack for being rusty but they tell me that it doesn't matter, and my step mom doesn't want me to use the computer because she doesn't want to share. Its lead me to skipping classes because I feel like theirs no use in going to school, it would be cool to know how you would handle this situation and if you can give me any advice.","sorry to hear that, but been in a similar situation after taking some time off of school. My best advice is to take the minimum amount of classes possible so you get too overwhelmed. For me essential to plan my assignments in advance, so that I can just do things one by one and not let it all get piled up cuz then I wanna die. Also, if you need a break, take one. School will always be there but good to take care of yourself too :)"
Depression. So any non med for depression ?,"The generic answers heard over the years tend to go something like the following; exercise, sunlight, talking, therapy, stroking animals, eating healthily, meditation and writing one thing thankful for daily. I say with sincerity that any of those have worked for me but helped others. Keeping busy with hobbies on the days able to function might help. It does slightly for me."
"All the people who will be kissed on New year's eve. I'll be alone like usual  I'll never get someone to kiss me  It's fine  No one understands how hopelessly, alone, and angrily some people live. It would scare some attractive people that haven't ever lived like that.","Hey, just wait it out. I know what you feel. Sometimes I think I'm attractive, and sometimes I can't even look at myself I'm so disgusted. I've come to realize it's all just a fucked up mind game I play with myself. I doubt you're actually that ugly, you're probably kinda cute honestly, but if you're anything like me, you've tricked yourself into thinking you're ugly.  If you want people to want to be around you, you have to do some basic things like showering, putting on actual clothes, smiling, excercising a little and pretending you have confidence. It's honestly dumb, but these things can be hard to do, especially if you struggle with low confidence and depression. But if you take care of yourself, it's not too hard to find people. And just you wait until you find a person to kiss on New Years, because the feeling is worth the wait.  I know this is all a bit corny, but if you ever wanna talk about anything I'd be more than happy to :)"
It’s terrible being alone in a crisis. Just wanted to express this.,No amount of 'you are not alone's from internet randos who won't reach out to you after will help. My local mental health system is an absolute joke and often made me more suicidal. So I also am alone when in crisis.
honestly what is in this world for me.. nothing thats what i feel like living to make other people happy when they only like me cause they feel sorry for me not cause they actually like me jesus i live such a sorry life.,at least you got people trying to comfort you. I even dont have that. Again there are people who got it Much worse
Why the fuck am I depressed. I don't even remember when or why but I just feel empty  Like I'll be having a great time and suddenly I just want to go home and sleep  It's so fuckin dumb I just want to be happy  I'm not even sure why like is it because I'm a little overweight? Or stress? Or because I can't get a girlfriend? Because that's a stupid reason to be depressed  Why am I doing this to myself  How the fuck do I fix this  Why do I write all this trash thinking people will actually read it,"Does there need to be a reason?  Depression is an illness, and like any other illness it doesn't need some form of justification, it just *is*"
"The world is really pretty.. Pity, that I won't be there anymore to cherish it.","You're a good man, Median. I hope you know this. I hope that you have people around you that will tell your story for centuries, and that you live on as a hero in the minds of newer generations. But, I'd rather you live, personally."
"Don't know what this is.... Not sure if this is the right place but here I go.  I feel alone, I feel trapped in my mind, I feel like life is a cycle and I don't know what to do anymore. I have gained weight in the past 3 months, everyone has noticed it all my friends and family. I have never been depressed nor ever felt like this really, only up until maybe 5 months ago. The thing is that I have not had anything traumatic happen to me to make me feel like this. I've had family problems but I don't really see that as a problem i've dealt with it for many years. Is it possible to be depressed for no real reason? Are these symptoms of depression?","Thats totally normal, most people get that from time to time. It will pass, the when is the real question. Good news is you can work on the when, at least it works for me. I think the key is to accept whatever you are feeling, not fight it and not try to change it, even try to get yourself to cry. The point is really to change your mindset from 'i have depression i can't cure it, it is killing me' to 'i'm sad again for no reason, human brain is a pile of shit and buggy as hell, I'm gonny cry all day to give it what it wants'.."
Having kids is the most selfish yet selfless thing a person can do.. I just wish I never existed.,Yes you are right from my experience.Not dealing with my problems. I isolated my family. It just came second nature.When they don't understand me.I kept busy on the shitty computer to avoid my problems. I realize that the worst thing i could have done. I need to try harder and put my family first who means everything to me.
Why does death make people sad?. a relief from the hell known as life,I don't really think life is he'll but I don't understand the weird sadness or fear of death that people have. I've known a few people who died. I wasn't sad at all. Everyone I know is going to die and one day I am going to die. Why is that sad?
If anyone will listen. I'm in a bad place right now. I could really use a friend.,"No friends here, willing to listen. Need someone to listen to me sometime too. I'm going to bed right now, but if you want to message me I will get back to you tomorrow."
"When everything is a challenge. Tying your shoes..eating..pulling your shirt over your head, even just walking. Everything is hard like you're climbing up a mountain. What I wouldn't give to see the world differently","ive just sat in my room crying my eyes out thinking mostly about this. Conversations with people ive known my whole life i find difficult, its not natural. Everything feels so forced! im sick of trying so so hard to look normal. I hide my feelings from absolutely everyone and im exhausted. No motivation in life, feel like im a waste of skin"
I don't wanna go back to a psych unit a third time.. I feel like I'm being pushed over the edge. I don't want to go back to the psych unit for the third time in a 6 month period. What do I do?,"Omgosh. I just want to validate this feeling because I have been there. That said, if it's a matter of safety, there is no question. You know that you need to go. You just do it. It's not some kind of failure. You are taking care of yourself. It DOES super suck though. Don't let anyone tell you it's all fine and fun to go through that. I've been there. I've come out the other end and been okay for long periods too though so I mean, it doesn't stay like that. Hang on. It gets better."
Feeling really hopeless right now.. Can anyone offer some positivity or good vibes right now?,Write here one good memory of something nice happened recently.
Nothing works. They took me off the one pill that worked. The pill I'm on now is the worst one of them all. Should I call them and tell them? I dont know who exactly to call. Please kill me.,What were you taking before vs what are you taking now? Are you being prescribed by your general doctor or a psychiatrist? Do you feel like you are in danger right now?
"I'm gonna become an alcoholic. I don't want to. I haven't touched a drop of booze in my life. I don't really have access to it, as I'm underage. But I think more and more about drinking every day, and I wonder if it will work to mediate the symptoms just a bit. My grandfather is a recovering alcoholic, and I don't want to follow in his footsteps, but I know I will eventually. I'm just waiting to see when I snap.","I'm down in that hole. Don't get sucked in is my advice. You'll get nothing good out of it.  The thing with alcohol is that, once you start drinking too much, too often, the idea that it makes you feel better is entertained while it is not true at all. It's: *I drink to forget, but I've drank so much I don't know what it is I have to forget. So I drink, just to be sure.*  Alcohol and drugs have become a habit for me and I can't really live without them anymore. I need them to maintain a level of tolerable shittiness - but trust me, I'd be way less miserable if I never started it."
I’m okay all of the sudden. How can i be so fucking depressed thinking about suicide every single day to just being fine? been a month or two since been feeling suicidal and out of nowhere i just feel ok. What. The. Fuck.,"Thought I was ok and it passed away for half a year, but now it is coming back, and it hits twice as bad as before."
I've been in bed for 5 days. I can't seem to stay up for more than an hour at a time. Tomorrow is my last sick day. If I can't get up I will lose my job. Somehow I really don't even care. I wish I could just blink out of existence.,"Get up and take a shower, and then go for a walk so you can clear your mind. That usually helps me after going through one of these periods. It sucks, but you'll get through it. And don't lose your job, you don't want to end up on the street. You're stronger than you think, there's just a cloud of depression around you that's obscuring your vision. Stay strong and don't give up. You can do this."
".. Why do I always have good news followed by a shit night, followed by sitting up at 2am wanting to kill myself? Why is life so difficult? Why is it so impossible to be fucking happy for once in my shit fucking life? What's the point anymore?",well not for nothing but you made it extremely difficult to read your post by only using a period in the title. JUST saying not judging.
"Does anyone else sleep early to escape thoughts you get at night?. I always see people say how depression causes them to stay awake at night or become lethargic during the day but after 10pm, I become increasingly paranoid and depressed and so I force myself to sleep. Just want to know if anyone out there is the same...",i used to. rn im in the area of not going to sleep so tmrw doesn't come
how do I get $100 quickly and easily?. I want to buy weed. of course some one who is depressed like me needs drugs. but im serious i want weed so i can just smoke 24/7 to help with the depression.,I mean fastest way is a pawnshop or trading stuff into GameStop
Since we all hate the world and how unfair it why dont we all just become humanitarians. :) even though the bad outweighs the good at least we we will be helping others :):),"If I had any will to do something good, I'd be doing it."
"Had a dream about my parents falling apart and crying because they thought I'd killed myself.. Dream!me hadn't yet, but was unable to tell them because for some reason they couldn't see or hear me. So all I could do was stand there beside them and watch them break down and cry. Thanks, brain. I haven't been feeling shitty and hating myself enough recently while awake.","Okay, so feeling shitty is necessarily a shitty feeling. But, even subconscious you is empathetic and cares about others, which is a beautiful fuckin' thing to be. It's why you have the capacity to feel so bad, and it's also why you can (if you want to) be an amazing resource for people. Being able to feel things as deeply as you or I can is something to be cherished and protected and put to good use. The world could use more empathy, you know?  It's okay to hate yourself too, btw. Just be honest with yourself about your good traits as well, yeah? &lt;3"
changes. i see no changes wake up in the morning and i ask myself is life worth living should i blast myself,"Each day repeats with the only change is it gets worse, preach man."
"my problems are insignificant. i get bullied. i bully myself. i get beat up. i beat up myself. my family the best, but they the worst. i have things to look forward to, even if they provide a minuscule amount of happiness. other people have it worse. i whine. i am insignificant.","Pain's pain. There's no point in comparing our suffering to someone else's. Depression doesn't demand that you have a good reason. On a surface level, there's a lot about my life that people would even be jealous of, but that doesn't make me any less miserable. You're the only one living your own experience, no one else can say whether or not it warrants pain. If you feel something, you feel something"
"The only thing getting 'lit' this weekend are my fall scented candles.. I am so lonely. I'm in summer vacation and I just lay in bed all day, and browse random shit online. I wish I could do fun things, but Nope, couldn't even get that in life.","Treat yourself to some body lotion, chocolate icecream and maybe a glass of wine while you're at it. Couldn't ask for a more relaxing weekend than that."
who cares if i exist?. today is a sad day. its just one of those days i guess. i'm just kinda done. theres not much to look forward to these days. everything is just kinda the same.,"I care, man. Hang in there, things will get better eventually."
Someone please come and break my legs and put me in hospital. I can't go to work anymore,"Dude. broken my arm so bad that I needed a titanium rod. I was in hospital for 5 days. Let me tell you that it was the most depressing and humiliating thing ever. I was in a ward with a man who was dying from pancreatic cancer and another one who was about to have his legs amputated because of diabetes. It is absolutely miserable seeing them alone throughout the entire day waiting for a visit and sometimes they have anyone come over at all. Furthermore, the medical staff were stretched so thin that I had to scream and bear unspeakable pain for 45 minutes before I could get my shot of painkillers. This was after they had attached the rods to my arm. Oh and last but not least, absolutely humiliating to use the restroom or shower. I understand and appreciate the efforts the medical staff commit but I really help but feel embarrassed when they shower me or escort me to the restroom. wish to be admitted to the hospital. EVER."
It was my 20th birthday yesterday. I had no emotions at all towards it.,Mine is coming up and I am generally indifferent to it. I told my family I don't want to do anything for it.
"It's my 18th birthday, everyone is congratulating me and to be honest I'm surprised I've made it this far.. Everyone wonders what I want to do with my life and I have no idea. The reason I have no idea is that I didn't think I'd still be alive today. I thought I would have ended it by now. Happy birthday to me",Congrats on your birthday. I've never thought as well that i might see my HS graduation this year.
"I'm contemplating suicide via ruining my life.. If I can't do it quickly, then I'll do it slowly. I'm in no rush. I mean fuck it. I'm going to be miserable whether I'm working my dream job or being a cashier at McDonald's. What's the point in taking up something someone else is gonna enjoy more?",Maybe one day things will become brighter for you to see it in a better light so that dream job might be ideal
emotional trauma/neglect and being re-traumatized on top of the depression. I can't take it anymore I just want out.,How did the trauma come about?
Fuck it. My girl and I broke up and im done. I was doing so well. Been clean for months now and now... I just want to die and get it over with.,I hope you're still here. It gets better.
Everyday I ask myself why I haven't killed myself.. And as each day passes I have less reasons.,"If there's one thing I regret not doing, it's that I didn't kill myself when I was 12 and actually attempted it. It's been all downhill in the 15 years since."
I finished a 6 hour motorcycle ride between two states.. Why didn't I get hit?,a motorcycle ride sounds super cool. i can't even force myself on my bike.
"Why is it so easy to blame ourselves?. It's strange, sometimes when I make mistakes that clearly not my fault I blame myself for it, but why is that and how can we stop blaming ourselves for everything?",I'm trying to increase my self worth so I stop doing this exact thing. My frustration immediately gets taken out on the one thing I seem to hate the most: me. I've started to set small goals for myself every day so each day feels like a success when I achieve those goals. This has led me to branch out and actually put myself out there. In doing so I'm discovering a passion for mental health advocacy and rekindling a love for doing creative stuff.  I'm not saying everything has immediately gotten better. Holy shit it hasn't. But this helps at least a little for me! Hope you can find omething that works for you. Let me know if you wanna talk about it
Is the good even worth it?. idek anymore. Too much bad...,The good is worth it! Hang in there! You can get through this because you're stronger than this! You can make it through cause the good will be worth it! Lots of love!
People said try finding yourself a goal. But I have goals. I can't work on them because I feel tired. Which makes me feel more worst due to my failure.. I am not sad I am just feel...given up.,i guess the idea is that have something strong enough to motivate you towards it. I personally have goals but I never have so I really help you here.
I have become comfortably numb. afraid of who I am becoming,What does that mean in practice? Are you one of those persons who got tired of being used so now you use others?
I feel so alone. And it hurts so much,Please know that someone out there cares for you and would be heartbroken if you here.
"It would mean so much for someone to just notice something is wrong and ask if I'm okay. Just once, I want someone to know I'm spiraling down without me having to pour everything onto them. If they'd just be interested enough in my well being to *ask*...","When I read this, I had to think of a girl in our company. I saw her like 2-3 days a week, always with a sad face. So, one day I just asked her, if everything is allright.  She said Yes, of course, thanks. How about you?  I answered with I'm fine. But I don't believe you. If you're ok, why can't you smile for just... one moment?  She said: ... I never knew, that it was that obviously. No one ever told me that.  I answered: I guess plenty of people know that something isn't ok with you, but most people just care about their own shit or just don't know what to say. If you wanna talk... I'm here.  She ended the dialouge with Thank you....  And she never wrote me again since then. I felt bad somehow. On the one hand, I just wanted to help, but she refused it somehow or I scared her too much. On the other hand... maybe I just made it worse for her, and that's of course not what I wanted. The human mind is a thing, no one can explain. It's infinite."
I can't even drink to escape my sorrows because I can't stand the taste of alcoholic drinks. So at least you guys have that going for you haha.,Weed make my sorrow funny
I think God laughed the day he put me on this Earth.. Depression is the cruelest punishment of all.,"He's laughing at all of us, that sick fuck."
Anyone feel homesickness at home. I know that sounds strange but I think that's the best way to articulate it.,"No time to find link right now, but Sarah Silverman said exactly this in her interview with Terry Gross on Fresh Air a few months ago."
"hit a big depressive dip recently.. a combination of parents yelling at me, dissatisfaction at life, and mixed feelings about everything brought me into a low point again. i feel like i've broken yet another thing inside me.","I was like this at 16-18 all I wanted to do was sit in front of my computer and not leave the house. It wasn't like I was actually doing anything productive but on youtube / games I was just rotting and completely ok with it because it stopped me feeling that deep void inside and the negative voice.  I am now 28. Iv'e managed to find a little bit more of a balance between technology and life but I am still depressed and cycle in and out of this. I would look into an addiction though, it is possible to be addicted to electronics (especially gaming and the internet). If you feel like you're agitated and your depression is linked into computer usage you might want to consider that your depression and negativity is linked into an addiction."
Stress fasting?. Do you folk get it? When it gets rough I pretty much won't eat for 4-7 days,I have the opposite problem. I eat and eat and eat when depressed. Sometimes when I have bad anxiety I eat though.
"What did you live through in 2018?. Every year, my mom has the family reflect on things that we've gotten through during the year. Good or bad, we made it through something. So now, I'm asking you the same thing: What's something you lived through in 2018 that you can now say, I made it through.  &amp;#x200B;  What I lived through: losing all of my friends but making a new one, concerts, trip out of my home state, and making photography work I can be proud of now, getting on stable meds.","very cool accomplishments! a photographer as well, love to see some of your work if you wanna share.  at the end of last year my girlfriend of two and a half years left me, i had to move back home with my parents and lost all but one of my friends. but it pushed me to finally come out as trans and get hormone therapy. one year later and i feel like myself for the first time in 22 years. a few months ago i stood up to my shithead boss and quit my job working repossession. i really miss the money but miss slaving away for 80 hours a week and now looking into getting a job dreamed of since i was in highschool. sometimes things really do happen for a reason."
"Depression and Anger are best friends if not the same entity.. I'm at the point in my depression spectrum where everything makes me angry. All day I experience silent rage. Things piss me off more than they did before. And this is the way i isolate myself without knowing it at times. My family tells me they don't know who I am anymore, they ask why I'm mad all the time. My partner does not get fair treatment from how shitty I treat him.  My whole life is that feeling you get when your mom tells you to take out the garbage right before you're about to go sleep. Little inconvenience after little inconvenience turns into full on discomfort being awake and always being pissed off you have to do anything at all. I don't know how to not be mad anymore and it scares me.",I feel the same way. I'm angry and depressed. It takes a lot out of me emotionally to do little things like run errands. I hate interacting with people. They state at me funny and act like I'm scary which makes me angry. It's exhausting.
Anyone else have a hard time this time of year? Looking for some help.. I have 2 kids and am having such a hard time getting into the Christmas spirit. The darkness makes me tired all the time and I feel like doing anything but going to bed.,Personally I hate Christmas and all the Christmas spirit crap.
Anyone else feel incapable of being happy?. No matter how good things are I just can't seem to be happy.,I just feel like I don't have a purpose. Like while I need things to survive. The things I need don't need me.
I cried for no reason in a public place. That was the first time I really cried in a crowded place.,I was close to doing this so many times.
"im at my lowest point in life. i keep on failing at everything i do, i have no reason to live. Please help i cant do this anymore. Its become too big for me, i have no idea or hope on what to do. Please, help.",I'm here. I'll try to help.
Got back from therapist.. and it was useless... she only questioned me why i dont work and why i dont have any meaning in this life... useless visit for a useless person.. well i guess its time to stop this..,"I felt this EXACT way when I first went as well. I felt like it was a grilling of my life, and I even tried to lie and say that I'm mostly 100% happy with my life and that I just wish I had more friends and cleaned the house more. YEAH RIGHT. I'm a mess a lot of the time and have so many problems I dont know where to begin. Eventually once I started to know my therapist and dive into the smaller issues, did she really start to open up and I opened up myself as well. Keep going. The first day is the hardest I think"
"Have you ever just stared blankly at a car's headlights as it speeds towards you, wishing that it would it would hit and kill you instantaneously?. You close your eyes accepting the promised bliss of death... and the car stops. You slowly sink bank to reality as you open your eyes again and walk on.",One of my old therapists used to tell me that these were still considered suicidal thoughts even though I actively planning to do anything. I always told her it was just wishful thinking. Lol.
Wish my parents would die so I could commit suicide. I don't want to be alive.,"My current goal is to outlive everyone that cares about me. It seems like the nicest thing I can do for them, and it also grants me a chance to figure stuff out. All of my self-preservation instincts are driven off of the pain I would cause loved ones if something were to happen to me, in all situations, and that fear is what keeps me going during the worst of it. If you can't do it for yourself, try to carry on for someone you care about."
"My dog ran away today.. It's my fault, I left the gate wide open. I feel like shit.",It really is one of the worst feelings. My dog who was my best friend for 6 years was just gone one day when I got home. That was about two years ago and I still miss my buddy
I miss my mum. I'm just crying a lot today and.I'm really depressed because I miss my mum,"I'm sorry, my friend. I lost my mum too, two years ago. I feel your pain but it'll get better for you, I promise."
"I hate the good days. I'm really starting to hate any good days that I may have. I get one every month or so and it's quite possibly worse than just being depressed. It dosent matter how happy I am or how much I try, I know it will be right back. And worse than a normal day. After a few hours I fall right back down.  I honestly don't know why I'm still alive. My life has just been a series of fuck ups. I should be a functioning adult by now and yet I can barely think straight. I'm just running in circles, I do the minimum to survive. Daydreaming is my only escape and even my depression is inhibiting that. Why, why me, why any of us. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.","You got it all wrong. You should be looking forward to making more of those happy days, if you force yourself to be sad simply because you know you're depressed, you'll never get over it ever.  Hang onto those days and strive to make more happy days each month. Depression is fed from negative thought process, let it starve"
"Maybe I'm not depressed. Maybe I just don't like living.. I mean, I don't seem to have ANY depressive symptoms except being generally dissatisfied with life and being suicidal.  None of the drugs worked. None of the shrinks helped. Maybe living really is just a shitty, boring thing in aggregate.","Everything is pointless, all our feelings are illusions because they are all brain chemicals. I don't see any meaning in life, there is no purpose, no happiness, no satisfaction. Why being happy/wanting to live is the normal quality of a human? Can't depressed be normal too? Is depression real?"
I feel numb. This year has been so hard. I have never felt loneliness like I have this year. Overwhelming feelings of sadness and despair wash over me as I am just walking long the road or sat at work. It takes so much energy to pretend to be normal for family or colleagues. I am so tired.  My day used to be happy. I used to find joy in things but there is no joy left. But I know that I don't feel empty. Far from empty as there is so much darkness inside me. I feel numb. Does anyone else feel nub?,"What I can say that I can relate somewhat to your situation. Upholding social standard is hard and especially hard is keeping in line with what your family wants from you. You need to be able to find joy in new things, in what you find interesting currently, even if it isn't exactly accepted socially and your family might not like it. It's your life, not your parent's."
"Anyone else has nothing worth living for?. No friends, no job prospects, no romantic success to look forward to. Makes life look like an utterly pointless waste of time. Anyone else struggling with this?","Not in the same way - I have a job (and prospects), I have some friends, but I live a life in solitude, since I cannot enjoy spending time with friends or people because it amplifies my depression - and I have no clue why. Maybe because I always feel alone, even when in company which makes me avoid it. So yeah, it's not what I'd call a life worth living and at least somehow related to your struggle."
"Anyone take mental health days from work?. Do you use vacation, PTO, sick, FMLA?","Back at my old job, I used sick leave."
"Depression shower thought. Common saying out there that suicide is selfish, but what a lot of non-suicidal people don't understand is that people who are suicidal know that the people around them will have better lives if they were not in it and know that being alive is selfish.","I think it's more like...suicide IS selfish, but so is asking someone to not commit suicide.  So the argument is just kind of invalid because it's merely a question of who gets to be selfish."
"Sometimes I wonder why I even try. I've never really overcome depression, because it always comes back worse than before. This is the worst I've ever had; I can't go more than 5 minutes without thinking about suicide.","Same, well obviosuly I don't know how you feel 100% but I thinks its appropiate to say I can relate to you deeply. Why don't we try distract ourselves, even if its just 5 mins. Listen to a song you like, watch a small video, browse r/eyebleach or even go drink water. Im gonna try and watch something in youtube to at least try and not think about you know what. Wannna try with me? :)"
"I have been a Freshmen for 3, 1/2 years. I don't even blame my depression , I am just dumb. I was at community college for three years and now I am on academic probation in a university, this is my second semester here and I only have twelve credits to my name. I am trying , I really am but it's just hard and hopeless. The other day my parents told me we made room for your future degree , next to your siblings degrees! I am twenty-two years old going on twenty-three. I don't know what to do.","It took me seven years to get a bachelors, and a lot of that was done part time or online. Do it on your schedule. Nobody else's."
Its silly how out of the blue it can hit you and ruin everything you built mentally up to that point.. especially during the ACT. fuck me.,"Its not silly, its cruel ;-;"
It’s like I’m driving with no driving wheel. And just wishing for the car to hit a wall,Except we're all driving on a flat plane
Your entire reason for existing explained in one word.. Work. . . That's about it.,Revenge. . . On a life thrown away.
"Getting out of your situation or not is a choice.. Paraphrasing what a former friend used to say. Splendid, I felt so enlightened I could cry tears of joy.","Well yeah, but what about the relatives and the mess?"
Anyone feel numb/epmpty. I don't really know of its depression but I figured you guys could help. I have this number feeling where I just don't feel emotions other then sad or angry I just feel empty. Like I'm just a shell with nothing inside just going through life. I don't really know what to do with myself I don't want to kill myself because it would hurt the people I care about most but at the same time I can't feel anything other then everything suck why am I here. It's really tough to even get out of bed in the morning all I want to do is cry. Does anyone have any ideas on coping with this numb/empty feeling because nothing makes me happy.,"Hellow, is bad to hear that you're doing bad, I feel kinda the same, don't kill yourself, you're going to die anyway, so try and enjoy as much as you can. I hate how my life is right now, I feel empty and bored with everything/everyone, but.. **I love being alive**, you know, even tho existence itself has no meaning, we can just try and take the best out of it as long as we can."
"Today is my birthday. I should be happy and shit, but I'm just empty. Does this happen to you, when you should be happy but your just empty? This sucks. Want this shit to end","Happy birthday bud :)  Being a Virgo has its perks... this isn't one of them. Always a perfectionist, never happy with anything. I feel you man.. tomorrow is my birthday."
Idk. It's 5 am and everything is hitting at once,same man I feel you
"Do any of you guys feel like me?. For some background, I'm 18 and in my freshman year of university.  For a couple months now I've just been feeling sorta weird. It's like a long funk. I don't know how to describe it. If I had to choose, I'd say I feel empty or indifferent. I'm still able to laugh and find things funny, but a lot of the time I just feel like a machine, doing things because I have to. My motivation is minimal. A part of me is just not transitioning very well from high school to university. I don't like it here and I don't know how to describe it, either. Maybe out of place? Not fitting in? The environment here is just cold. I've been looking forward to sleeping more lately, but I dunno if that's just my exhaustion from late night studying/work or something else. I think I failed my chemistry exam and the course and it doesn't really phase me. I don't know what's wrong. Am I depressed? Do you guys feel similarly?","Sounds like apathy to me. I'm guessing you feel kind of lost and without a direction and you just are following the path that you feel is required of you. While apathy is one symptom of depression, it doesn't necessarily mean that you have depression. By no means am I downplaying depression or trying to convince you that nothing is wrong because there isn't any on true definition of depression. I felt like you for a while, just a few small pleasures but nothing really else. For me, it went away after a few months. If you want to talk about it more or anything, feel free to ask anything. My only advice is don't give up now, because if it goes away, you'll regret a lot of things that you stopped caring about."
"I'm curious about how anti-depressants have affected you. I've been dealing with depression since I was 12 (I'm nearly 19 now) and in the past, my doctor recommended anti-depressants. I was hesitant because I've had friends say it essentially makes you feel like an emotionless robot, so I ended up declining that option entirely. I feel like my depression has only gotten worse and worse and am now looking to meds as a last resort. To anyone currently/previously on anti-depressants, could you tell me how it's affected you both mentally and physically? Thank you all &lt;3","Really depends on the particular medication. Everyone responds differently as well. I have mostly had bad experiences with antidepressants, but I am not a good example. I know people who really improved while being on them. It is a bit of a gamble and it can take time to find the suitable med for you. I would say it is worth a try though."
I've had depression since I was 8 years old and I am now 21 years old with no recovery.. This makes me incredibly scared of my future...,"Depressed since I was 9, I'm 23 now...I totally feel you, you are not alone. Thankfully life does seem to get better for each year that passes, I deal with the severe depression as it occurs and try to enjoy the times when it's milder. Good luck to you in life."
Does anyone else feel normal late at night?. I find myself depressed mostly morning-evening. However I feel content and relaxed late at night,Late at night is pretty much the only time I feel normal. Too bad I waste most of the night on sleep.
"Feeling dead inside. For the last 1-2 weeks feeling nothing inside, like most of the other people, dont know what to do. Thoughts in the middle of the night well, i might die, i dont have what to live for. Literally void of nothing, black space.","As someone who's felt the same, what do you have? And I'm speaking objectively, because I typically don't want to admit that I have what I need when I feel as you do. Not that I'm saying that you do have a lot, but your post doesn't necessarily shed a lot of light on what's going on. It's easy, or it has been for me, at least, to say that I don't know what to live for, in the past. Somebody out there cares, man/woman, small or large. I don't know what your situation is, by your post, but feel free to message me if you want."
"Feel like I'm forgetting what enjoyment is. Time with my partner doesn't feel fulfilling, not like it did. Even my zoo job feels routine; I don't do much there, and today, I feel dull to it. I hate this; I don't deserve numbness, I should be grateful for my life. Depression, thieving fucker..","You deserve it! No one does! should yourself, though. Try to roll with it instead of beating yourself down more. You could comfort yourself instead and see what that does."
The 20's. Are the 20's supposed to suck this bad. I want to fast forward to when my life gets better. Kind of like a click remote.,Will pray for you my friend. Pray lift these things and issues up to God. Pray without ceasing. Put your faith and trust in the Lord that he would help you overcome these issues and struggles. I wish you the very best. God bless you my friend.
Feel so lonely and hopeless... My mind even clear enough to articulate my thoughts to write here clearly. I just feel so lonely and want to die.,"YOU ARE NOT ALONE!!!! You posting here proves that. No matter what give up. There is always a better day, a better year, and a better life. There is so much help waiting for you. Talk it all out here if you need to, we judge and we can all relate. Please rob the world of your life! PM if you need help or need to talk, always willing to!"
"Lonely in a crowd. I'm hanging here at a party of about 75 drinking, and I feel completely alone.","Exactly. Don't worry OP it will be ok, if one of your conversations got awkward just shrug it off, it doesn't fucking matter. If you see someone alone , go talk to them. If everyone is in a group just be like hey guys what's sup  , again don't try to be weird just be yourself. People will accept you I promise. It's best if you try taking to one person, it has much better results so go do your thing"
Feeling nervous when happy. So yesterday I felt happy for the first time in a while and switched from my depressing music to my happy music. I quickly switched back to my depressing music because the happiness made me feel uneasy and nervous. Anyone else have this happen to them?,"Yea, things go more wrong when happy. Kind of. Really I just get more nervous because I suddenly have that happiness to lose. When Im depressed it is what it is, but when like carrying a bag of money through a bad neighbourhood at let me lose lol. I be happy if not risking something. The risk and fear of losing the happiness, is part of how I feel good. Like, I feel proud that willing to take that risk. If that makes sense? Be careful with music, powerful. I have stuff I listen to because so good at effecting how I feel.  Also, your brain releases a lot of chemicals when happy for the first time in a while, if ever had an extreme sugar rush, or done cocaine lol, it can be overwhelming. normal though."
I don't why but I just cut myself out of sheer boredom. I don't know why this happens and how to stop.,"Replace cutting with something else. When you wanna cut do something else. I smoke haha but seriously maybe theres other things that you might enjoy. Before I lost all motivation for anything I used to like running till my body hurt. It releases endorphins and other good stuff. I can vouch, I felt good afterwards."
no friends for 10 years. no gf. ugly. wtf do i do?. I'm a 24 year old old man.,"Depression is a hard fight. I am 29, on meds and I still struggle. All I can add is to start with yourself. Keep a daily routine, like hygiene or reading, find something that allows you to clear your mind and be calm. Go to work or go to school and be yourself. Always find something that can make you laugh. A great sense of humor and a good personality can for real change the way people see you. I had terrible acne as a child and hated how I looked, but as I grew older I gained more friends through my humor. I only really have 2 friends but they are great friends. Quality over quantity and all that jazz. As for being single I too am in the double digit bus. I go from periods of loathing being alone to being numb to being okay with it. My friends and the things that make me laugh help ease that pain."
"despite being on medication, the depression is coming back. it worked so well, i thought finally i can feel normal again  well that were some nice 2 months but now im feeling like shit again  have some side effects as well and in about 1 month ill see my psychiatrist again  lets see if i can survive till then",When did you notice you're feeling crappy again?
"Anxiety/panic attacks. How do you guys deal with anxiety/panic attacks? I used to have them a lot and could discrease them but never really stop. But now they're back on like, almost daily basis and I really don't know how to handle them at all.",Medication. My panic would feed on itself to the point where I'd have done just about anything to make it stop.
"I wish i had cancer. So my family was helping me, instead of judging",Dude don't say that man your family loves you and trust me you do not want cancer
"Depressed.... I've faced the biggest betrayal ever, and I am depressed as shit. Any thoughts?","actually, you've faced the biggest betrayal up to date. Wether a bigger betrayal will happen in the future or not, you can't know. so if i were you i'd try to get over it. Life may be short but a betrayal is just an event in the story. Flip the page and carry on!"
I can't stop comparing myself to everyone else. I don't even know who I am anymore--just who I am not. This past week was really rough...,"Even if I won't do it, other people will constantly do it for me."
"About to clean my room. Need a little encouragement.. I'll report back when I'm done or how the progress is going. I have to use adhd medication to get me to start, even though I tend to do other things instead, and the come down makes me think bad thoughts.  Sigh. Wish me luck.",Should this really be in depression
".... Feeling hopeless and useless at the moment... Empty, lost, darkness",Some days I just want to lie in bed and listen to sad or angry music.
"Can’t sleep, Any techniques to suppress my depressive thoughts about my future and fall a sleep?. I just sleep more then 3 hours Please help me","I just make up fantasy stories in my head until I do, maybe you could find something similar to do?"
Living in the past .... How to be more present..,"Yesterday was yesterday, today is today. Tomorrow is tomorrow. If you have one foot on the past, and one foot on the future, then you are pissing on the present. Think about that one."
Anyone else use to be smart and then after years of being idol you became stupid. Happened to me. awful. I think from constantly disengaging myself,I was the smart kid getting straight As. Now I struggle to get Cs.
"That feeling when you look at the dental bill.... ...and could scream in agony, realizing no one but yourself is to blame for abusing you by neglecting your teeth, including expensive previous dental work that's now gone to hell. Depression carries some very heavy lessons.",That feeling when your teeth are rotting away and you're too scared to go to the dentist.  :(
I don't really want my depression to go away.. Its a part of me even though it keeps me from doing anything it also makes me me. Suicidal thoughts are a large part of my personality.,Strangely.I feel deeply so I know I will always suffer deeply.
Had to promise not to kill myself. Dont think i can keep it.. My therapist made me promise to not kill myself but i cant keep suffering,"I had this perception for a long time myself. But I realized eventually it's because I wasn't reaching out to them myself. I'm here, and I haven't forgotten about you. I'm here to help! :)"
Sister is depressed how can I help?. My sister is 4 years older than me. She has been depressed for at least 4 weeks maybe longer. We don't live in the same city. Based on your personal experience what kinds of things do you like to hear from a loved one? That makes you feel better?,"This is really sweet. Send her horrid memes, lol. Or maybe remind of something really funny that happened between you two in the past. You can mail a small box for like $5, mail her a letter and some of her favorite candy. Any small thing you can think of that just might put a smile on her face would probably help. Even if just a phone call or text."
"Depression and addiction. i have been suffering from depression from when i was 13. I am 19. I don't have any friends. If i die right now, no one will notice. I am adicted to heroin cocaine and methadone. I need help or I may die.  &amp;#x200B;",Have you tried admitting yourself anywhere?
Not going to kill myself but I really want to die. What is the point?? Everything is shit anyway?? I really didn't ask to be born and then my parents put this life responsibility on me. Anybody else feel like this?,"omg lol I 100% blame my parents. After taking an AP Psychology course at my school, it kind of shifted my own perspective on my depression. I know I can't claim to be an expert after reading just one textbook, but even an idiot can realize that your behavior and who you are is just totally as a result of your parents. The genetic aspects aren't their fault of course, but they are perfect human specimens, so you can imagine what 17 years of always being wrong has done to my self esteem and thought process. Strangely, being cognizant of that fact doesn't change it much. Of course, I've directly told my parents I blame them for who I am, and as perfect specimens, they told me that I can't keep blaming them for everything. There's truth to that of course, but it's rather incredible that they can find the gall to abdicate themselves of all guilt and responsibility. I'd better just get on my hands and knees and obey their every whim, since they're the ones who work and pay for my existence, regardless of whether or not I can actually do jack shit about that (child labor laws, yo). Lol sorry your post is just so relatable I had to rant."
"Talking to people doesn't help. No matter how much I vent, nothing actually helps me and I still feel the same.",Do you see a therapist ? Maybe a medical treatment with a psychiatrist and regular appointments could help you ? I have been doing it it and it has been helping me
I hate going to sleep knowing I’ll wake up in the morning.. I wish just end already.,"I understand. You regret going to sleep knowing that when you will wake, it will all be the same. Nothing changes, same problems different day.  But I have realized, slowly and painfully, that the changes won't happen unless I make an effort to try and change things  Currently I keep getting pissed at myself for staying up as late as I do, drinking myself to sleep, and hoping that in the morning, something new will happen instead of what really is going on in my life.  The point I'm hoping to make is that we need to make the effort of change if we really want to change how our life's are headed, and we need to hold to that change."
Any good literature or media about depression?. PLS help I haven't read anything in years and I feel like something that can I can either relate or help me through this will help me out of this rut,"I can only recommend fiction (apologies; not much of a self-help/non-fiction kind of guy) but The Perks of Being a Wallflower (the film; never read the book myself) deals with depression among other things and is very powerful. Much of Sylvia Plath's poetry centres around mental health and depression, if that's of interest, and while it's not something I've read 'The Bell Jar' (which is prose) is also supposed to be very good, according to a former acquaintance of mine. And I recently finished watching an anime called Orange which was mostly very good at dealing with the issue, the one caveat being that characters tend to talk about 'saving' people quite a lot, which can be a little bit galling (lol). Music-wise, Brand New have done a number of songs which either deal with depression (or emotions that can be closely linked to depression) or are pretty evocative in that sense tonally-speaking. Can't think of anything else right off the top of my head but hopefully that's a fair amount of stuff, in the short-term at least"
depression is an endless fucking cycle. you're depressed so you do stupid shit. you make your life worse. and you get more depressed. cycle continues,Fucking true. Made some bad decisions including a drunk driving stint last weekend and now I'm trying to deal with the consequences. Feel like I'm being punished for being self destructive.
Holy hell why cant I sleep?!. I just started taking Zoloft a few days ago and since then I can not fucking fall asleep. I'm not an idiot I know it's a side effect but shit this is annoying. I have school in the morning,"been taking Zoloft for a few days and it made me more sleepy then ever. Today I only took half a dose (25mg instead of 50) and I feel less drowsy, but worse."
"3rd week im skipping school. Kill myself&gt;going to school, I wish I had drugs now...","As a 24 year old that needs to go back to college and pay his way there. It is absolutely imperative you succeed in school to get tuitions for college. I know what you're feeling, well actually mine was worse since I had little friends but if I could back and give myself advice I'd tell myself to man up and do well, work out and socialize because the rest of your life is so dependant on how well you do at your age right now. Please believe in yourself and press forward.  Although you have all the time in the world to make changes. Waiting it out will only lead to insanity and depression. It's a problem you don't want to deal with when your older. It's best done in the present."
"What do you call someone,. who has the solution in their hands, ready to use instantaneously, and yet doesn't do it and chooses to continue whining about their life?","not sure. I whine about life all the time but if I had the solution, use it right away. be gone tonight!"
Happiness is hard to come by.. I don't know how to be happy... it seems like there's always something lingering that wants to put me down.,I like to start with really tiny things and small moments.
"I don't want a partner or even just friends because I want the freedom to kill myself, with the least number of people affected.. This way, it's only my parents and siblings who will be saddened.","I used to imagine hoping myself out of existence, because wishes usually fail. In any case, I'm just recently starting to appreciate how all our lives are connected or rather it's a delusion to think there was never a connection to begin with, else itd be different.  Anyway, it's ok to take some isolation to figure things out, but life's like riding a bicycle."
How to become an Introvert ?. It may sound wired but i think that being extroverts suck and becoming Introvert may help me in depression and anxiety and the worst i think i have BPD.Can someone give me a guide on how to become an Introvert. Thanks,"Introvert here, I still get super lonely I just stress out about what I would say to people and every single thing I can say wrong."
Trust is a curious little thing.... We take it for granted... until we eventually realise: it's a concept that doesn't actually exist.,"You're wrong. It's hard to trust and you may get burned, but you have to be willing to take that risk. There are people who care about you."
I failed my suicide attempt. I tried to hang myself but I was saved by my mom. :(,"I'm glad your mother loves you and was there for you. I hope you are able to pass through this time and feel better.  Perhaps find a local nonprofit to volunteer at. Something simple like a food bank, maybe a soup kitchen. That way, you can know that by being alive in the next few weeks, you have a direct purpose. It's something small, but it will make the lives of others better, because you lived. You can build from there and go on to help more people."
I feel like drunk me is the person I'd be without depression. With drunk me I mean being drunk and on xanax,I feel you. I'm only happy and at ease when I'm drunk. I'm sure I'd drink a lot more if I had more disposable income.
I want to die. I fucking hate myself and my miserable existence. I'm a shitty excuse of a human being. I can't even kill myself properly but that probably won't stop me from trying again soon.,"What makes you think you're a shitty human being? I don't know who you are and I don't know your story, so pardon me if I'm coming as rude by saying this (that is not my intention, I'm solely trying to help), but maybe some of those reasons aren't founded. For example I often worry that all the people I love will abandon me, and even though it's not really founded and I know in the back of my head that it probably won't happen, it is still one of my largest fears."
how do people deal with deprrssion. I got depression recently. Iv4 never had it before. Some days I wanna end my life and some days i am happy. How do people overcome this,"You don't overcome it. You learn to live with it. Its who you are and there's nothing wrong with that. I find thrill seeking helps me. I'm sure it's not the most productive strategy, but it definately gets me to keep waking up. If you ever need to talk, feel free to message me."
Does anyone else have a hard time getting motivated to exercise?. I find exercise almost unbearable w/ depression.,"The only way I'll exercise is if it's a real task that matters, like jogging to get to the bus stop on time or lifting furniture at work. I can't do the whole exercise for the sake of being healthy thing. I don't care enough about my health for that to work."
Does abstaining from masturbation cures depression?. At least for some people?,"Well I will find out because I can't even stay hard anymore, so I'm giving up on it. Going from 7 times a week to 0."
I've been laying in bed for 2 hours. I've been laying in the dark with my eyes closed for 2 hours and still can't fall asleep. I have to be up early for classes too. This sucks. I just want to sleep but my heart is pounding and i can't stop thinking. It feels like I'm wide awake.,I always have herbal OTC sleeping supplements prepared in case that happens. Relaxing teas works too but then you are sleepy and have to go to the toilet. In many cases they work pretty well.
Sometimes I know that I am doing something that will make my depression worse but I just can't stop!. Over eating not making plans with friends ETC ETC,"Oh crap dude me too... I keep lying in bed all day and binge-eating junk food (like, an entire bag of hot cheetos and then more) and l always end up feeling even worse after but l can't stop."
I can't keep going.. It's getting very hard just to put up a fight.,"What currently feeling. If you want you can talk to me. Rant it out, listening"
"Hang myself so much I've moved up to face cutting. There are times where I would like to smash a wine glad into my face, or fantasise about having my head smashed in. Today I started cutting my face.","Why the heck do we hate ourselves?! Man such as crappy lie we have bought from seriously the pit of hell. Nothing else could be so evil as to make us not believe we are worthy and deserving of a good life just as much as everyone else. Sorry to get weird there, it just makes me mad that anyone has to feel this way about themselves. Anyway, I have one scar on my arm from one time that I tried that and there forever. It still makes me sad when I see it. so sorry for what pain you are in. There will be a time in your future where you will not feel so much pain and will hopefully even feel better about yourself &amp; the future you will be so thankful if you permanently scar your face."
Sometimes it difficult to ask for help. What is worse most people won't be willing to help.,Sometimes you got to find the right people to help you is all. I think you would be surprised sometimes the people who would be willing to help
"Life is unbearable, what can I do?. I'm stuck in a prison. don't know.",felt like that before and I honestly know what happened to change it. pretty sure I just got so good at hiding it and acting happy just started to believe myself
Is it normal to be depressed ? Or is there something else wrong with you. I think i am but is depression just an excuse for something else ? What do you think I'm not sucidial I think it's selfish,"Maybe. Maybe its increasing because people are getting convinced by others that they're depressed? But it is a sickness, so that sucks"
I don't want to be here anymore.. Currently debating whether or not to end it. Im so lonely and lost.,not alone. PM me if you ever need someone to chat.
"Anyone tried ketamine infusions for depression?. Considering trying this treatment for depression, anyone already tried it?",Haven't tried it but know a medical professional that says it really works for many patients. Not covered by insurance though.
"Why do I only want to sleep, cry, and eat? WTF is wrong with me?. I stupidly quit my job last week. I was becoming close with a guy that I stupidly became a jerk to all because I couldn't control my mood swings. My boyfriend only wants to fuck me. WTF should I do?","You are capable of doing things on your own. If your boyfriend doesn't make you happy, you don't have to be with him. If you are worried about coping, you can take things slowly, step by step. I should follow my own advice here as well: don't be afraid to seek therapy if you can. It will help, even if it only helps a little.  As for your job, I'm sorry it didn't work out. But don't let things ruminate in your mind. Worrying about them over and over does nothing to help you. *Depression thrives in rumination*. Try looking into mindfulness meditation. It's not spiritual garbage, it's literally training the neural pathways in your brain to put less weight on particular thoughts, so that you don't get stuck in negative feedback loops. It takes time to change your brain structure, but it can be done. Another thing is to find distractions. Productive is better, but if you keep the less productive ones in check they can be helpful also. Delve into hobbies or learn a new skill. Be social and try new things. That's the best way to cope in my opinion. I need to take my own advice."
I wish I could be drunk 24/7. I hate myself and my life. Nothing is enjoyable for me anymore sober.,Same. I drink every night. I look forward to 731 every night so both my kids are in bed and I can pour myself four shots of whiskey
"Gym anxiety.. I've heard that exercising regularly helps deal with depression. But, I feel too anxious to go to the gym to exercise. Any tips on how I can deal with this?","There are judgment free gyms out there such as Planet Fitness. Alternatively, you can buy your own gym equipment (e.g., dumbbells, resistance bands, etc.) / videos (e.g., P90X, Insanity) and work out at home. Exercising has definitely helped me with depression, but for me, it wasn't a magic cure. Exercising did bring many other benefits as well though, including health benefits, physical appearance benefits, confidence benefits, etc. So I highly recommend it"
"I spent today either staring blankly at a computer screen or my phone. Was too hurt to do anything today, really.",That's an accurate description of the past 2 months of my life.
I want to tear my skin off and become a new person. I feel like I'm constricted,"If it was possible, we would live again but we are stuck in this."
"My last love was my last love. Fuck this being in love isnt worth the pain when it ends. Im done trying to have proper relationships, when I next manage to get a job I'm just gonna start seeing prostitutes. Only female attention ive ever got any chance of having in the future anyway so fuck it.","I completely understand. The way I felt for my ex was unlike anything else. I never had such a connection with any other person before. It's been about 8 months since we've broke up, I'm still grieving. It's made me fall back into depression. I always thought I could do things myself, but I just realized recently that I can't. I can't always do things alone. I really just crave affection and appreciation."
Anyone else hate social media stories?. Also lives bc they show other people having fun together just at the same time that you're sitting alone in a dark room wishing you weren't born. Also I see lots if things I wasn't invited to so that's always great,"Exactly the reason I stay away from Instagram, facebook, and snapchat now. Always makes me feel like shit"
when you find out drugs and sex are boring as hell. wtf do you even look forward to?,I wish there was something to look forward to.
Does it help?. Does seeking a therapist or eating medicine helps?,"Therapy: it works if you have a good therapist who helps you understand yourself; why you feel or don't feel certain things, ways you bring certain miseries upon yourself. Also if they are a champion for you. What I mean by that is they empathize with you rather than shoving psycho babble down your throat. They offer real tools for help. Also, you have to put in the work. Therapy doesn't fix anything. Just helps educate you on how to better handle yourself. Meds also work, but sometimes you have to try a few different kinds to find the best fit for you. They don't work overnight either; they can take upwards of 10-14 days in most cases before your brain starts to readjust. For me, I found my original dosage wasn't strong enough after a year or so and had to double up."
"I saw a photo of myself from a year ago. I... can't believe how much the anxiety, stress, and sadness has aged my face. I look like a different person. When did this happen?  Has this happened to you too?","Unfortunately im thin anyway and through depression i lost weight because of no appetite.With 24 years of age i look like a 14year old boy. No beard ,just 56 of height. Fuck me."
how to know whether .... I am depressed because I don't do anything or I don't do anything because I am depressed ?,"I can't speak for you, but I don't do anything because I'm depressed. I used to do things but gradually started feeling worse when I'd go out. Now when I try to make plans I can never follow through with them. I feel so bad about myself that I can change my mind about doing things very quickly."
2017 has been my worst year. Without a better future in sight either :)),Each year just keeps getting worse haha please end me
Anyone else occasionally have to go to your car or the bathroom during work to just cry?. Sometimes I just keep myself together for the whole work day,"I would totally cry at my desk, no one even noticed."
"I swear if one more person tells me: You only have one life, there is no time to waste worrying, you have an entire future ahead I will kick him/her in the crotch.. I am just tired of being tired of the same soul-sucking routine engraved in my DNA.",All it does is make me feel worse because just feel selfish
Hey!. How is life treating you today?,"Very shitty. And you, OP?"
Another twelve hour graveyard shift. And I forgot to take my meds.. It's gonna be a long night &lt;/3,Sorry to hear that. Hopefully it goes by quick.
"There's someone for everybody. The problem is, I'm nobody.","I don't have any good advice :( , sorry. This absolutely embodies everything I have ever felt, thanks for at least finding the words."
First step... The hardest step.. After enjoying 6years of depression and dark stuff on this sick brain... I've taken this step now. A few weeks in a mental hospital. Hoping to get out. Not sure why i Tell this here. Maybe hoping that others can take this step to. Good luck to all who are in this shitty shituation. #smallsteps,"After hearing every line in the book, I found this single reddit post surprisingly helpful"
Hey guys. until the exam is half a year left . but I understand absolutely nothing. I feel like I can not fix it . What to do? Maybe to kill myself? But how? Also I have so many many problems.... ah. Depression.. help?,What help do you want
"Bank account will most likely hit 0...another job interview where I'm not the primary candidate. Still very unsure of my future... I'm plenty sick of living woth my family, and yet there's not much I can do about it.","Sometimes it's just the environment you're given, and you have to adapt. I'm very impressed actually that you're able to go to another job interview, it shows some hunger and motivation. And that's the blessing"
"I never asked to be alive, so why do I have to stay alive?. It wasn't my decision to come into this world. If no one wants me here than why do I have to work this hard to be here?","Youa re comdemned to a life of freedom. Is an old quote i tihnk its from satre, but im not sure. And later there has been others who disagree. You are forced to become alive and aware that much is for sure. Unlike most animals you are a creature born with the abillity gather information and draw conclusion not jsut based on your senses, and that oftens leads to the question. Why am i alive?  Not only that, you are forced into not just a world, but a particular part of the word, which then in turn will teach you values and conformaty, and for some people this works out well. If you can find it in yourself to look at the context you have born into and be satisfied with it, enjoy it and love it, if you can find shelter, food, sleep, joy, love and challenge in you enviroment. But for some of us, we don't fin those things, we suddenly find ourself in a enviroment that conflicts with our nature, the context of our existence is not operationable with the essence of our nature.  You first statement i cannot, say is wrong, you didn't decide to exist, but netiher did you chose not to. And existing in of itself is not evil or good. But if the context of your life is making your life or nature feel haunted and painful. Then a there are options available. The first thing, no matter how you want to change your context for the better, rquires that you step back and see the context.  Where are you from, what values have been impsoed on you, which makes sense to you which doesn't, how has these values been imposed, who has impsoed them. For these purposes your reasoning is a great tool. It easy to finda figure head or a single person to blame, but you really have to map it out, and see udnerstand ana analyse your einvirotment and the people in it, and then find the conflicts with your nature, the pain and sadness.  Then you have to figure out a plan. And this is a tremendous task, not just do you have to think thoguhts you ahve not been taught to think, you have to be critical of a system that raised you and shaped you. You have to go against the nature of what normal is and accept yourself. And then you ahve to find out how you want to change the context of your life.  alkohol amkes me miserable, and everyone i know drinks Find people you can exist with with out alcohol  My father is violent Create an existence were you are independant from him  School is terrible translate My class mates bully me daily Find another school  thes are simple i know, and jsut examples. Now i know you asked why do i have to do all this hard work and i threw some of the most difficult work and ideas at you. But the things is all what ive jsut said is the reasonalbe arguemtn for you nature, essence and existence and a way to improve it.  when you ask why, reason is not a tool that can answer. its like trying to build a ship using lead, sure maybe it can be done, but its deffinately not the best way.  Refelection, abstract thought, contemplation, emotion, empathy. those are the tools to arrive at an answer.  If reason was used, human life wouldn't really have value. If you were the head of state and only used reason, you would quickly realize, human lives are not what drives you foward, what makes progress and creates a super power. And lives could turn into numbers. Sure educated people anda strong work force is good reasonable arguments to have a population, but only if they are educated or strong. Using reason to determine worth of life can lead to terrible ideas or no answers.  You have to work hard right now, because you are worth it depsise allt he pain you are in you are worth it, and you deserve to be your best you. And if you don't liek working 8 hours a day then sleep 8 hours and then have 8 hours for yourself. Then there are options, but because you born into this context you ahve to work hard to get to those oprions. It is hard to change your enviroment.  You have to stay alive becuase, you know a humans life has worth and you are one. When you see another in pain you wish he wouldn't ahve to be, when i see your words and want to help you but am incapable i still try. You have worth because of all the thigns you have not done yet, and all the people who have not enjoyed you future self.  Stay strong friend  Love  I wish i speleld better"
"Not even 2 weeks into 2019 and already everything is going wrong :(. I was alone on new years as expected, don't know why I thought this would be my year. Already I have had a swollen infected gum and now what seems to be a kidney infection. I'm back to my crappy sleeping pattern and it's still the same old bullshit. A crazy family fight and other stupid shit. Why do I have to suffer, why can't I just have one good year? :(","I feel for you. Even minor setbacks can feel like major hurtles when depressed. found that setting small goals talking to myself positively helps. Maybe just start by trying to eat, shower, and get to sleep on time everyday. If you can do that, then consider the day a success. Having realistic expectations can help you be nicer to yourself. It sucks that going though difficult things and that may not fair, but gotta accept shit. Just work on the little things, my friend! So many things are out of our control."
does it still count as exercise if i go back to sleep after?. like...i wake up early and run for a little bit then go back to sleep for the rest of the day. I do it but i feel like i accomplish anything and that makes me feel worse. but i wonder if maybe it is helping too sometimes.,"If you do it, it counts."
"I just feel like shit.. I don't really know why. Everything's just so overwhelming all of sudden.  I was feeling great this past month, but it's back. Did I do something wrong?  I don't know why.",I feel like shit too everyday. I just wanna fade away.
Lost In thought.... Why do I feel like living is so pointless?,"I think it is objectively pointless, humans seek meaning in things, and life has no definite meaning.  For me, it's ironic, on one hand, I want to die ASAP maybe in my sleep, on the other, I want to live as long as possible to witness how far technology can reach, especially for astronomy and VR.  I suppose what I'm trying to say is, as many had said before, we have to find our own meanings. We have to find 'joy' somehow, within this pointless struggle until the day we die. It's tough, I know, for I suffer the same."
Please help me. My ex fiance told me he's dating someone and doesn't want to get back together tonight after leading me on for two months. It's taking all I have not to kill myself. Please help me.,"Im sorry that guys are douchebags. But honestly there are better people out there. I promise you out there there is someone who wants to love you. There are always people who want to be your friend, like me! I hope that you wanna talk more. -Reaper"
Medication that works?. I have been dealing with depression for a long time and I have tried a few medications with no results. Was just wondering what medications have worked for people so I could look into them and their cost / side affects. Thanks in advance.,"Medications work differently for everyone. Usually your doctor or psychiatrist will prescribe you with different ones depending on what you have tried that hasn't worked. I have personally been trialling all different medications for approximately 4 years now with no luck, I have been through almost all of the available medications."
"I just want to end it without affecting my parents. Just nothing is going well. The ruminations of past situations have been getting worse and no one is very understanding why it's so painful, to the point where two people just got fed up with me and made me feel worse. I just want to kill myself so badly.","Man, I fucked up really hard and my parents payed for it. I just fucked up again and they are paying for it again. It is the same mistake as before. I just keep relapsing and each relaps costs a lot of money and affects our relationship. I see no hope for myself, I will keep relapsing forever. I feel like killing myself would be the greater good."
"32m never had a girlfriend. It sucks that I've tried hard to find someone, even with online dating, but I feel like I'm going to be single forever. Not sure if I should just give up or keep trying",33M here and gay. Never been in a relationship. Probably one of the most painful things to deal with. I feel like I might as well give up too at this point.
"Cutting. I'm not sure why I broke my streak of 8 months of no cutting but I don't feel any different, nor pain. I don't know whats wrong me. Help?",The reason I use to cut is I couldn't point to a part on my body and say it hurts here. It made me feel better at the time but it wasn't a real solution. You are in pain Broski. If that was me I would think that I had maybe an extra bad day/night and tried to fall back on old habits.
"Does anyone actually ever go to their high school reunions?. I couldn't imagine anything worse, not even hell itself.",haha when I come back home I never even go out into my home town. I can't tell you how severe that problem is - if I met an old friend I'd black out...had a dream it happened...it's awful. That's the social side - could you imagine the questions?? What are you up to; what do you do etc. FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK that
Vodka and malt liquor are not working anymore.. I need lots of vodka tomorrow.,You've built up a tolerance.
My cat got shot by plumb and is dead now. I would have loved to never born and now I have to face so many things like that and I am so scared about dying and this world is so unfair,"I'm sorry, that is so sad!!!! It is a cruel world. But you make it better with your kind, sensitive heart."
I wake up and just want the day to be over already.. Like I have nothing to look forward to.,I know the feeling. I'm just so tired. I don't want to play this game anymore
"i dont know what im living for anymore. there's nothing i'm truly looking forward to that is actually achievable. there's nothing but dread and anxiety for the future, both far- and near-. god damnit. i dont know why im alive.","You could look forward to getting better. Slowly, and maybe never fully cured, but better. It's a good thing to aim for, unattainable as it seems."
I had more motivation as a sperm. I won a big marathon against billions lol.,That was my first and last W
"I made it through my first 40 hour work week without calling in, leaving early or coming in late in almost a year.. I know how but I did.",If I tried this I'd be getting up at 3:30am instead of 5:30am....
I wish i was dead.. Its nearly 12 midnight. Does anyone cares?,You are not alone. Just remember that.
"“Remove negative people from your life.”. I always see this little tidbit in articles about how to overcome depression. Bitch, the most negative person in my life. not the problem, I am. I want to be friends with/date a cold stone like me either. So should I just remove myself from my life then??","That statement is bullshit. I'm the toxic, negative person in my life."
Eating food but it tastes bland. I can't even feel happy with pizza.,Get some yummy ice cream!!
"I don't really see a point in living if my life is like this. My depression is probably at the lowest point it's ever been and no matter how hard I try I can't seem to get any help. One small, completely irrelevant moment in my day can change me completely, and I really don't like who I am when that happens. Sometimes I have days when I'm so happy I literally shake, and every morning when I wake up feeling my usual shitty self I can't help but wish I was having another one, which just makes everything so much worse  I just want to be normal again, instead of feeling like every day is another complete waste of time.",I agree. Last week I had a day where I was so happy and everything was fine. Then one thing didn't go the way I wanted it to and I was crying at work within the next hour... hate feeling like that too.
"I can't be the only one to fantasize, right?. I have been spending a fair amount of time fantasizing about stuff lately. It's about tons of stuff really and I like falling to sleep while doing so. Does anyone else do this?","Like crazy, video game all the time, im scared to not, getting really bored of it tbh, but cant do nothing, brain will kill me"
"Nobody really cares that you have depression. It’s not even considered an illness in most people’s minds. You get more support for having a cold than depression, even thought 1,000,000 people die from it each year,. Title says it all really. Most people care that you have depression. In most minds, something you snap out or just up, not that They understand the existential loneliness and emptiness that comes with it, in each waking moment. I just feel so disconnected from everything.","It's usually innocent ignorance. Most people don't understand doesn't mean anything for what's true, except it's really difficult to have an illness that goes unrecognized.  &amp;#x200B;"
"wow, being yelled at that you're too negative sure makes me feel better!. it definitely doesn't make me feel worse or anything. yelling at a depressed person is definitely the correct choice, instead of being supportive.","Oh, my family does that all the time. Like, what do you expect.  Also, when they say they're feeling worse than I am for having to watch me depressed. Like, hello, I'm depressed here, not you.  And when they try to blane it all on my anxiety and my negativity, like I'm to blame people generally don't like me."
"“Fetishizing sadness”?. I just finished binging BoJack Horseman, and something that gets brought up semi-regularly is your own What is this and how do I avoid it?","It means that you have transformed your misery in a fundamental aspect of your identity and anything and everything that happens in your life is gonna be somehow linked to that. It is gonna become impossible to differ between what is truly a hardship from what you are deciding to see as such, because pain has settled within yourself to the point that things would not make any sense if it was not present, so you will inflict it upon yourself to return to the only state of familiarity that you know: being miserable. The term fetishizing is used in a harsh, accusatory, pejorative way, blaming the characters for perpetually watching their lives through the blackest prism, but the truth is they just do not know any better than to do so. Furthermore, fetishes are often believed to be shameful and obscene in nature, because such random, nonsexual items PRODUCE intense satisfaction, whereas people that are accused of fetishizing sadness are just sheltering themselves (if i fuck myself up, no one else will)."
"Has anyone here had success with Mirtazapine (Remeron)?. I've tried Zoloft, Prozac, Citalopram and Venlafaxine (Effexor).",Haha. Same exact medications. No. It did nothing. Didn't even notice it.
I just want it all to be over already. it would be a whole lot easier than this shit,"Whats the fun in easy?  We all die in the end... there is no reason to rush it :)  nothing matters beyond what we want to matter, but if you conclude that life is meaningless and boring and hard then whats the point in that perspective? If it is meaningless then what else is there to be meaningful? what do you base those views off of if nothing else has a point for existence?  Of course that assumes you actually think it's pointless or meaningless... or hard, which you do there for, how do you know something you've never experience is easier?  Ah my rambling gets me nowhere because no one else cares to see it that way... eh oh well.  Anyways, what is troubling you?"
"Just go into my dream school.... But my depressed ass doesn't even care that much. I really want to be thrilled but people keep saying congratulations and I feel nothing.  Edit: can't even spell the title right. Got, not go",What are you getting into?

"I feel like my only friends are the Youtubers I watch every day. And they're clearly not actually my friends... they just make me feel like friends are around, I like seeing familiar faces and hearing familiar voices joking around because that's the only time I get to experience that. How pathetic.","Yeah I'm all about this - fairly sure it's just a digital opioid but when I'm lonely they're always around for me. To be fair though I'm different than most ITT that I watch lots of documentaries, food shows, and makers. If you like food/fermentation and hilarious personalities I'd recommend It's Alive with Brad (from Bon Appetit) or Action Bronson stuff from Vice; and if you want a room full of weirdo friends, doesn't get better than the Chris Gethard show"
"I will never be anybody's favorite.. I will always be the backup, the good friend. Someone else will always be picked over me. I have never been somebody's very best friend, and I never will be. And that hurts, so very much.","I of course don't know your situation as well as you, but i think it could be worth a shot to organize something with a group of friends. That way, you are involved because you are organizing. Idk what's going on with you, but i think it could work out"
"does anyone else find sunday the hardest day of the week?. I find myself at my lowest on sunday. probably because I have things to do, and places I'm expected to be. but sunday is just unbearable. anyone else?","I can relate, I hate having no structure at all. I just know what to do with myself all day, and I feel very lonely."
Has anyone here quit their job after a short period of time?. I'm thinking about doing that. I'm not happy at work.,I quit my job recently but I've been here for a year and a half. I'm so glad I'm leaving though. This place makes me suicidal.
Depressed and IDK why. Does anyone else ever get Depressed and have no Idea why. I've felt this way for about a week now and have no idea why and no idea what to do,"My best suggestion is to talk it out with someone you trust, explain the feeling you have and express what you feel like doing. If you continue to feel this way, seek help from a professional. Hope you feel better"
What does it feel like to love yourself?. It's a geniune question. I am curious because I've only hated myself.,"I don't know if I know exactly. I've had feelings of contentment and I guess warm feelings, but I think it's more than that. I think the best way is to sometimes look at yourself like you are a close friend and treat yourself accordingly. Because actions make a huge impact and if you do things like removing yourself from unnecessary stressful situations and not committing self-sabotage (me sometimes lol), the road gets a little brighter. May you walk on warm sands, traveler."
Feeling pointless. My life is feeling pointless and meaningless. My kids are almost grown and they're never here as it is. I have no career or anything to show for my life and just feeling worthless.,Aren't you proud about your kids

"Can I even consider family as family anymore?. I tried hanging myself a 2 weeks back, and my parents just stood there and watched. I failed, because the hook I attached the rope onto in the ceiling detached and I fell. My parents laughed and went to sleep a few minutes later, while I stayed awake the entire night.  Can I even consider them family anymore?",Is there anywhere else you can go? A shelter or a friend's house or move in with a sibling or something? :(
My brain is leaking.. Has anyone dreamt all night about some small task that needs to be done no matter how trivial it might be. I'm exhausted over a 5 minute project that won't matter if I do it or not.,"Same!  I have lots of homework that need to be done, but I do it, driving me insane. I even do simple always so exhausted. Especially at school!"
"Die... tired, things are getting way too hard these days. I dont want to commit suicide, for now. I hope just die in my sleep.",I always wanted to die in my dreams because I'd like to believe I'd get to stay in them.  Probably wouldn't happen that way.
How do you know if you have depression?. At what point can someone know? How can I diagnose myself?,"Not to sound harsh here, but do you have medical training? You shouldn't be diagnosing yourself. There are plenty of professionals who can do that for you and provide any help you may need."
I just woke up in a puddle of my own piss.. I lay on a inflatable mattress so my cloths and my cover just absorbed everything. On top of that its so I was shaking from being soaked. Why does shit like this happen to me? Just when I thought things were okay stupid shit like this happens. Fml.,"It could be a medical condition, and you shouldn't be ashamed. I recommend you see a doctor about it."
"A friend just died. A friend of mine just died. I don't feel anything, there's something that is very wrong with me. I should be more sadder but no, nothing, nada.","You should talk to your other friends who you had in common, not with us here..."
Every single day I get closer to my eventual suicide.. Every single day it gets worse.,"Not sure if you'll find this funny, but with each passing day, you *always* get closer to the day you die, natural or otherwise.  Basically, suicidal or not, every day is a day closer to dying."
Do you ever look back at the past few years of your life and realize how it has been slowly falling apart?. It makes me nauseous. I feel disgusted with myself.,"All the time man, still remember when i used to go outside, play with friends, not worry about anything and just live life till that one day when everything just fell apart i lost my friends, my motivation to go outside and be social, my parents trust its all gone and i can't go back"
im really tired. every day is too much.,"I support and am thankful for you, friend."
I just got up the courage to ring Samaritans. The number on their website didn't work. Go figure.,"That's some poetic bollocks, right there.  Don't they have two numbers? I've seen that someplace."
I cannot sleep!. Please why can't my brain just relax :(,"It's only about 1:45, there's still time to get some sleep, even if you're up early. Ultimately worrying about sleep isn't going to help you relax, and that's just going to make it harder to sleep. Try to think about something else"
Invisible. Went out tonight with a few friends. Went completely unnoticed again. Almost got into a scrap with some affliction wearing jock fag. Uneventful night otherwise as always. Why even bother.,"I can't remember the last time I went out with friends, I guess I'd have to have some first"

Will she give me a diagnosis?. Hey! I will see my psychologist next week for the 4th time and I'm curious. Will she ever give me a diagnosis or a detailed speech about what's wrong with me? because if not I know I will feel like shit I will just think that I don't deserve help.,"If she doesn't, you should ask about it. Talk at the beginning of the session and say I would really like to know your assessment of what's going on with me. I feel like it would really help me to know what you think, and what you think would help me get better"

"I'm terrified to seek help. I know I need help. Now. But I'm terrified, especially of what my bf will think. I know I shouldn't be but realistically it's a massive worry. I don't even know where to begin","Nothing to be afraid of, would your bf be embarassed to go to hospital after breaking his finger? No. Why should you be scared to seek mental help, broken finger hurts, depression if not treated can kill, and in the worst way possible.  Go and find yourself a therapist, someone you can tell all about your problems. Hope it works out."

"I'm trying to set goals for myself this weekend but can't.... I just have no interest in living, doing anything for myself... I know that I should set some goals that accomplish something positive for myself but... I just can't... I can't think of anything I want to do...","Here is a goal: get out of bed. I'm sure you are familiar with that crushing feeling where you just cant move because your depression is so fucking heavy. Just move a little bit. None is expecting you to be the fastest person in the race, we just want you to keep moving forward with us. A good goal is something achievable. On my broken days, my goals are to get up, take a shower, make a bowl of cereal. I'm a bit luckier than most, I have a wonderful wife and child, and they help me out when it comes to keeping myself moving forward.  Just tiny things should be your goal. Eat an apple. Stretch. Take a shower, fuck, take a bath. Dont try to solve world hunger, just do what is possible for you.  Message me at any time, we are all in this fight together."
My friends started to hang out without me and have straight up ditched me. I don't know what to do about it,are you quiet or shy? that'll be why
I hate being so numb that I can't even force myself to cry.. I just want to feel something other than empty hopeless despair. Even if it isn't real.,"Terror and pain always wakes me up. I occasionally deliberately start fist fights with my brother (who is a body builder) to kick start things. Or hanging out volunteering with kids; shit is the best. You get to read to them, or fucking play with my little ponies or Legos, watch cartoons."
"Why take anti-depressants? I don't understand. Why? If you do, than you aren't yourself. I want to be myself. I don't want to be some drugged-up person who isn't really me.","I've been on antidepressants for a few months now and I'm still very much myself. Honestly, I'm more myself now than before I was taking them, because now I can see the real me instead of it being blurred out by some dramatic cloud of self depreciation and suicidal thoughts. I've still got a long way to go and my depression is definitely still here but yeah. People take them because they help. I don't know where this idea that they turn everyone into emotionless robots comes from"
"I can't cry anymore. I haven't cried in over two years, I don't think I am anything anymore.","Hey dude i used to cry everday on the bus looking back at my awful day, so i grew my hair out super long so no one could see it. Maybe its better not to cry"
"Is this depression?. I feel empty inside sometimes. There's nothing there. No thoughts, no emotions, nothing. I'm just hollow.","Actually, if it continues over a long period of time, it could be depression. You shouldn't be feeling numb all of the time. Are you also experiencing sadness?"
When your friends all abandon you and you forgot what it's like to bottle everything. Having to go back to sucking it up and holding everything in and not having anybody to turn to hurts so much. Especially when I was used to somebody caring about me. That's what happens when your just disposable I guess.,"I am as well. The person who meant most to me threw me out like I suddenly meant nothing, and replaced me. He's happier now too."
Books to read that can help me with my anxiety. Hi everyone. It is a very difficult time in my life right now and would like to start reading some uplifting books to get my mind on other thoughts.. Any book recommendations?,Not a book but you should search up a spoken word poet on youtube called ' Shane Koyczan '. I was never into poetry until I heard some of his work. His voice is so passionate and calming and the visual effects help to focus.. for me anyway   Personal favorites are: Troll When I was a kid To this day
First thought every time I wake up. Is how and should you kill yourself today. be a good sign.,I wish there was an easy way to die. Like one pill I could just pop. Unfortunately everything has to be messy
"What's the point?. Why am I supposed to stay alive? I don't want to reproduce and I don't care for anyone in my life. I don't see a point, especially if I'm just going to die in the end.","It's a sad reality that everything comes to an end and that we're not given an exact explanation of why we're here or what the meaning of it all is. The way I see it is that we're here to give our life meaning one way or another. Since we don't know the meaning we have to make the meaning. Some people find that through their work, family, helping others, etc. Life is full of endless possibilities of what we can do with it. It's hard getting to the point where we feel like we're happy or accomplished but that in itself is another aspect of life and finding meaning. For some people it could take most of their lives to find the meaning that they were looking for and in my view I'd rather spend my whole life looking for that meaning and helping who I can along the way than to just accept that there's no meaning to it and end it since that's not really an answer. I may never get the answer myself but I can at least enjoy the journey leading to the end and maybe that in and of itself was the meaning all along. You'll meet many varieties of people throughout your life who will give you different perspectives of what meaning is to them and maybe that will help you on your journey and maybe it won't. We have the time we're given and what we do with it is dependent on us. Even after we die and join the rest of the universe in it's infinite there'll still be people around who will say, Hey remember u/OkayScience, I want to do what he did and live my life to its fullest. We can still be remembered for the life we lived even after we're gone and in that way we'll essentially live forever. This is the way I see life and it helps me from time to time. I still have my bad days and sometimes consider if it's all worth it but then I just keep going because I won't know if I just stop here. Plus it helps talking to people about it at times and if you do feel like talking about it more feel free to send me a message. Keep going with the journey and stay strong since you'll find your meaning in time."
I'm a fucking attention whore. You can't hide the truth,Are u boy or girl??
"For the first time in a month or two I brushed my teeth and washed my face.. Everything seems to be too difficult to deal with, but at least I could get myself to do these simple tasks again.",Yes. Doing anything is good. Specially these things that are just for yourself. It can be hard or even seem silly but if it is something you had to convince yourself to do and then managed to do it. That is good.
"I give up. I’ve accepted the fact that my depression and anxiety will never be gone for me. I will live with this shit for the rest of my pathetic life.. No matter what good thing comes into my life, those things will always manage to ruin it.",I'm sorry. I wish I could help. I feel the same way.
You think too much confirms what I've always believed.... Most people think too little.,"Yeah.  My parents took me to a psychologist when I was a teenager, and that was one of the questions she asked me. I felt two things.  1. How would I know? I don't know what normal is. I only know what my experience is. How would you? How could you even measure that? It's not like there are distinct and separate thoughts you can count, it's just a flow. 2. What kind of terrible precedent does that set? Since when is thinking bad?"
The woman I love is getting married in 2 weeks. I'm in denial. I'm in pain. She's all I want.,I'm sorry man. I wish I could take the pain away.
When was the last time.... Someone gave you a hug?,"If you don't count my mother or family members, about 3 years."
What's the point sometimes?. I try and fail. I try again and fail again. I want to fix my Playstation and get lost.,What have you been failing at?
I could easily do it right now. It seems so easy to me. Nobody cares now. But they all will soon.,"I want to repeat other comments, but do it. There is nothing afterwards, this is your one chance and you have to make it count. Life is like a train ride, there are turns, twists, hills, curves, but sometimes there are tunnels. And when your in the tunnel for a while you look back and forward but see nothing but darkness, it feels like it is all that is has been and will be. But tunnels always have an end. This train ride of life will get you where you want to go, as long as you get off early."
Do non depressed people really not think about suicide?. Even when I wouldn't have concidered myself depressed I still thought about it quite often. It blows my mind when people say they have never thought about suicide. I feel like everyone has at least thought about it once right?,"I guess for like short moments everyone has done it, but most wont remember it since it wasn't really a serious thought, just a quick idea."
help please. what do you say when someone says everything is wrong,"Ask them what's wrong, what's troubling you, how do you feel, what did you do today, how did it begin, when did it begin. But don't ask like you're interrogating them. Say it in a nice tone. Don't say it gets better, or life is worth living, etc. It's annoying to the person, always. It's nice how you care for them :)"
Another great start to the week. Just found out I have a practical today I thought it was next week. Guess I'm failing at yet another thing in my life,Well fair enough. I'm sorry there isn't anything I can say to help :/
I just want to drive away from this city and start again.... But I don't have a car.,That's my dream. Just hitch a ride to amsterdam and try to find some job
Will things ever start looking up. I'm on a downward spiral with no hope,"Thing will only start looking up when you do. Its ok to feel down and hurt for a bit, but don't let it consume you. I briefly looked through your post history, you're going through a break up, it's understandable. I am also going through a break up and depression came with it. You gave your heart to someone and expected them to so the same. When they didn't you became devastated. The truth is you're a loving caring compassionate kind person and deserves someone who wants you always. It will work out, things will get better but you have to try and make them better."
Oh ya. Fuck living!!!!! Wish I was dead!!!!!! I fucking hate life,"hey, wanna talk? im here for ya if ya want!"
"I'm so touch starved that I physically cannot fall asleep unless I have two pillows either side of me.. One for hugging, one for warmth. I genuinely look forward to going to bed. Those mornings where I wake up earlier then usual and can indulge in some daydreams while feeling completely safe and calm are my favourite.","My hairdresser place always washes your hair and is still relatively cheap, I tell you those 5 minutes feel so damn good. It feels so nice to be touched, especially by a woman. Sounds creepy, but Idc"
"Don't you hate it when.... ... you feel so guilty about living your life and being a burden to everyone, so you decide to commit suicide. But you can't because you feel too guilty about making others around you devastated because of your death.",I'll be thinking this all night tonight.
Wish me bday!. I have been severely depressed since last few weeks and thought my bday would be just as awful. But it's actually turning out great. I am actually happy it's my bday ! :),HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!! I'm glad it's a good day!
There is no help. Somebody just fucking kill me. There's nothing I can do,That's a bit dark. How did you get here?
"Lonely. I feel so alone. It's been going on for awhile now. There are people around me all the time, but it's like I'm invisible. I just want it to end. Loneliness really hurts. It's gotten to a really bad point. I may as well be gone.",Some days depression can be worse than others. Just try to make it until tomorrow. :)
"I love lying to customers. How are you?  Good, Thank you!",I always say Still alive
"I can’t get up. I am in bed awake. I need to go to work, but I move. I feel awful about it, I just need to get up. I took yesterday off, I take today off too","Good, glad. Do your best at work and I wish you the best :)"
Can somebody tell me it'll be okay?. That I'm doing fine? That I don't have to be perfect and that I haven't really done anything wrong?,"Of course you don't have to be perfect. As long as you're doing your best, that's all you can do. Everyone makes mistakes, no one is perfect. Hang in there bud."
im fucked. im fucked.my whole life is fucked,"wanna talk? msg me if ya want. im not gonna tell you what to do or why your life is not fucked. but im someone to talk to and i have been where you are and might understand you, in some way."
Why?. The question i often ask myself...Why? Whats wrong with me?,You're not alone with that.
Am I the only one ?. Is anyone not going to school or work?,It can. It didn't work for me (only get worse) but maybe it will a good experience for you. I really hope ...
"Do you cope well with Bipolar Disorder and if so, how do you do it?. And if you don't, why not?",Therapy and meds. I go to support groups every Thursday. I avoid alcohol. I read and write everyday.
"melancholic. I'm not depressed. I've been depressed a few years ago and I know what that was like - the mindset I was in where I beat myself up, felt shitty about everything I did, thought constantly about suicide, had weird emotions about my close friends/family and pushed them out..... i'm not there anymore. this isn't depression.    where i am now...i'm just not happy. nothing i do makes me happy. it doesn't mean i'm sad, or that i beat myself up, or i'm suicidal. i can have confidence in myself yet also not find joy in my life, and that's where i am right now.   i don't know what's worse. at least before i sort of knew how to get out of that mindset....",If you are not happy and you are not ill then you need to do different things.
I'll never be anyone's priority.... even though they are mine. :(,Maybe that is why we all are naturally depressed
"I get a horrible comedown after fun days of socializing. After good times with friends, I get home and feel exceptionally lonely and empty.. Maybe being an introvert it is just a draining affect? I dunno. It stinks when depression smacks you in the face after a while of feeling ok or even good.","The same advice applies to them in one regard. Need to know sadness to really be happy. It sucks that depression is part of my life, but it gives my character a unique value that is missing in others. Still would rather feel good without falling back into the void every time."
"Depression and capitalism. Does anyone else feel the way we have set up our western societies has helped trigger depression? I know when I think about life, surviving constantly but never happy, never truly living I become immortalised in depression and anger. Sometimes I feel buying land, living with a bunch of like minded folks and working as a mini community would help my feelings of utter contempt for life.","Lmao that's my plan honestly. Got sick of it, can't stomach shelling out $700+ a month when I earn $8 an hour just for a shitty apartment I'll never have time to spend in because I'm worried about making the rent for it. It's depressing and monotonous. I'm personally building a van to live out of right now, I plan to leave in the summer. I think of you have any itch to get out there and do something that makes you feel whole you should do it. I've dealt with depression long enough and frankly I'm sick of it, so I'm trying something a little new. Travel, fresh people, fresh scenes, fresh work. It won't be the most luxurious life but it'll probably provide more than the norm of working all day every day."
"does anyone ever feel like this?. You feel sad, but you don't know what you're sad about?","All the time. On paper, my life is fucking fantastic, but I'm still always sad. And I don't know how to make it better, because everything's already pretty great"
Anyone else not want a funeral or any services?. It gives me anxiety just thinking about it.,Does it matter at that point what I want? They're the ones left making sense of it. Let them do whatever they want.
I wish I had a depressed friend.. It would help him and me.,Yea i wish I had someone who truly understood.
Some people call it going to bed depressed. I just call it going to bed,I also call it going to bed... But its 1 am my time and I'm still too awake to sleep
"Does anyone else feel like being alone actually helps depression?. It's strange but it seems like when I'm away from people I can just be myself and do whatever without anyone criticising me, and I can also just enjoy the silence.","When i have good days i think about what was different. Many times my good days are ones i spent someplace else by myself. Like a town the next county over, for example. Recently i went into a city at dusk and just walked around by myself. I was never alone but i wasn't around anyone who knew me. It was good. Didn't end the dep but it was good."
:(. I feel like i no longer have emotions,like all emotions have been blocked off from me..
"Can't move. I don't want to expose myself to the outside world right now. They always ask me what I do. Right now, I'm not doing much. I feel extremely heavy. I can't move and I just want to die.","What seems to be weighing you down lately? If you need someone to talk to, I'm here. :)"
what will i be able to make of myself. no accomplishments. got nothing to look forward to,"Then makes some, and create your own future. Not the one you think people expect of you"
"No motivation, only obligation.. The motto of my current life.","Perhaps that's not such a bad thing for the time being - at least it sounds like you're still doing the necessities of life whether you want to or not and whether there's anything resembling pleasure in it. It seems that's how I've been operating for a few years myself - doing things because I have to not because I want to. At least we're doing them, maybe we'll get our mojo back and want to do something later."
Can anyone help me im in pain. Im in chronic pain and ready to kill myself,"Hey there, feel free to pm me if you need to chat. No judgments from me, just ready to listen, so feel free to say anything you want or need. Please stay strong."
Tomorrow I turn 22 years old but today I woke up with suicidal thoughts.. I've been trying to convince myself that I'm okay and that my life will get better but it's not.,"Hey i feel ya, today is my 20th bday, Im drunk in the middle of the day and thinking how to end everything asap"
"Thoughts on drinking.. Makes you feel better, calmer, but just more depressed","really depressed right now and I feel like it helps me been drunk that past 5/6 days and as soon as I sober up I feel like I do anything . I suppose the hangovers make it worse for a few days but when drunk worth not feeling as bad as I do when not drinking, I stand being sober and dealing with my thoughts. a bad cycle but I like to drink until my life kinda brightens up a little bit that way easier to be hungover"
"Am I alone because I'm depressed, or am I depressed because I'm alone?. It's been so long, I don't remember anymore...",for me i think its a little of both
Aaaaaaand..... ... im crying in school again :),"you can get through this i promise. hang in there, just get through the day. tomorrow is a brand new day."
Are there any graduate students with depression?. I feel so alone here. This is slowly killing me. I feel alone. Everybody in my program they all have shit going for them. I made zero friends so far. Anybody???,Does your school have any counseling or therapy? I think depression amongst grad students is way too common
getting ghosted. I just started getting ghosted by another person.,You have one of the best names ever seen.
"What are your strategies for staying functional enough to complete schoolwork, etc?. Due to feeling like garbage, losing memory/attention, and anxiety, I have trouble doing work for school. Actually, I'm probably just a lazy piece of trash, but the problem still stands. For those who are on top of things: how do you manage it all?","Lots of cannabis, which I can't even use much anymore since I lost my job"
Float tanks?. Has anybody had any luck using float tanks for depression/anxiety?,"I tried one once. It was a cool experience, but I'm also afraid of the dark, so it was a little anxiety inducing (they had a button to turn the lights on though). I don't know if it's really helpful, but it's still something I'd recommend, even if just for the experience"
"Do you ever feel like running away?. Do you ever just feel like running away somewhere far away, move to another city or country, changing your whole identity, exploring new things, finding new opportunities and meeting new people. Just leave this life behind and start a new one.",I have many times i have made plans and let them go i want to try agean just to get away from it all i just want to hop on a train and go whare it goes and maby be hapy for once in a long time sorry for bad gramer and bad spelling
"I trust my cat more than i trust humans. Actually no, i dont trust humans at all.. Im so done being used and lied to.","I trust my dogs and cats more than humans. Humans are fallible. Animals are just who they are. When it comes to trust in humans, it comes down to expectations. What are your expectations? When you enter into a relationship, it is something you should talk about. If you don't, you will find that everyone has different expectations. And you will never find a relationship in which you can trust."
does anyone else feel so much better just staying in their room by themselves for as long as possible?. i just wanna sleep and be by myself for a while but life responsibilities just let me. god i miss being able to stay home for days on end without anyone or anything else bugging me,"Yes. And i do like some company. I'm a confused person. Sometimes I like being alone, No one around me, sometimes I want someone with me ."
"I got upset but for the first time since I got ill with depression, I didn't cut.. Had another cry because I was so proud of myself.","That's wonderful news, you should be proud of that progress."
"Self-doubt. Sometimes I wonder whether I'm just going through a teenage phase. Even though I've been diagnosed with depression, part of me just wonders whether I'm lying to myself and just insisting in wallowing in misery.  Just needed to get this off my chest.","My gut reaction is that if you were just insisting in wallowing in misery, you wouldn't be wondering about this."
"I don’t think people love me. They love versions of me I have spun for them, versions of me they have construed in their minds. The easy versions of me, the easy parts of me to love.. But no one will ever love me",I feel the exact same way as you do and I'm tell my self that I'm fine. If ever want to talk about PM. I feel when you talk about your lonliness it helps to get through. I use discord and WhatsApp if that's your thing. Don't be to hard on yourself everyone in the world is loved by someone.
"Anyone else rely on porn to suppress the fact that you can't find love?. I feel like absolute crap when I watch porn but then again I don't have a girlfriend, or someone that I like to consider me to love. It's fucking corny but I thought it would help to share my thoughts, anyone else?","I think porn and affection are different really. You wouldn't love a friend just to fuck them, you love someone emotionally. Do you have a tinge of 'why the fuck did I do that' after watching porn? I used to see a lot of shit. It takes time to quit this drug that controls your actions. I hope you find someone, I haven't, but I just try and remember friends, cute girls, whom I'd never imagine in that situation. Buy a scarf and choke yourself until it hurts if you want to think straight."
"I need a drink. I know it doesn't help, I know it makes things worse, but I need an hour or two away from all the stupid little things that keep snowballing into stupid big things.",Having a drink is okay now and then. Most do it even when they aren't depressed just to feel relaxed. If you have problems with it then yes it can be bad for you.
I just want to stop existing. This feeling never goes away,Same I'm tired of waking up exhausted even though I get a good amount of sleep. Life is general is bullshit
��. I wish I could just drop this charade of happiness. My feelings aren't even mine anymore. I worry about putting stress on my loved ones. I'm so tired of this constant front that I have to put up when all I want to do is just cry.,I know the feeling :(
I feel so lonely. That's all I have to say today.,"Misery loves company...I just moved to a new state a month ago. Quit my job, left my family. The only friends I have right now are my landlady and realtor. It's really fucking shitty some days. Hang there if you can."
"Just need some support!. not feeling well at all. stuck in this place I want to be in, I get out of here because mandatory. I feel anxious and depressed, you know the drill.  All asking is for a comment or maybe a hug. I need something to distract myself with, music help, really that bad.","I just sent my support out, it should arrive in a few weeks, $3.95 shipping charges."
"A very dear friend died and i dont feel very different. Ever since the last year i was trying to convince myself that im not depressed and not diferent in any way from others around me but yesterday a very close friend died in a crash accident and my state of mind has not changed. Dont get me wrong, last night i cried whenever i thought of her but my mind and anxiety have not gotten worse nor better. 2 years ago, my school friend died in a suicide jump from a bridge and i know how i felt on that day and it's diferent now because then i felt diferent after hearing the news. Now i just felt like i needed to cry a bit, no sudden sorrow or anxiety attack, and that's what scares me that i trully am depressed. Can anyone give me some insight on what's going on with me.","being depressed means you're almost as sad as you can get, the fact your thinking about your friend is how you know you cared. Most people don't care enough to do that once they've cried a little."
depression. how do you deal with it,"I can't deal with it, I just push through everyday"
how does a weirdo become a normie ?. i need help on this -_-,"By spending time with people, in person. You'll probably fuck up a lot, make lots of social faux pas, feel like your the biggest idiot in the world (I do pretty regularly). However after a while you'll get better at being a 'normie'. Well as normal as people can be. We're all a fucking mess with no idea what we're doing, we just find other people who are a mess that are fun to hang out with."
Depression. Contemplating wether I should run away and never see my family again or commit suicide...,Preferably neither but if not an option then just run. Just die
My birthday is in 15 days.. I have never felt so unexcited &amp; Apathetic about my birthday in my entire life. Happy early birthday to me..,What day is your birthday? I turn 17 on February 6th! Do we have the same birthday?
Does anyone have an experience with Citalopram?. I have been put on it due to my depression getting worse. I was wondering if anyone has been put on it and what are your experiences with it? Do you find it's helped you?,I did several months on citalopram but eventually got moved onto escitalopram. I'm now taking Wellbutrin with the latter. Much improved.
"Does anyone feel like your problems are insignificant compared others, yet they still seem like a heavy burden?. For example, compared to the lives that some other people had to endure, my life isn't too hard. However, my problems still feel like weights on my mind.",I hate it when people say that. It makes you feel so guilty for whining.
"Has anyone else ever gone through hell, then met the person of their dreams, the person they're meant to spend the rest of their life with, and then you fuck it up forever because you felt it was too good to be true so you constantly started fights to make it feel like it wasn't a dream?. Fuck man, I hate myself so much now.  I don't hate my heart. I hate my brain. I hate my consciousness. My subconscious fuckin warned me to wake the fuck up and stop ruining things. But I didn't listen.",currently in a relationship. I keep thinking going to breakup with me or cheat on me. My anxiety fucks it all up.
"It's my birthday today, but I dread it every year. I feel like my friends are slowly forgetting about me or not caring anymore..","Happy birthday dude, it's actually my birthday as well today!"
"Every day I think; this can't get any worse. And without fail, the next day proves me wrong.",I'm the opposite of this. I just ask Can today be worse than what it already is? And Can it be worse than yesterday? Somehow it always manages to get worse.
"Does anyone else hate socialization?. I don't enjoy social contact and try to avoid it when I can. I never enjoy hanging out with any of my friends. Does anyone else have this? Is it depression, bipolar, or social anxiety? Or could it be something else?",I don't but I wish I did :/
Do you ever just feel bad for yourself for no reason. My mood can go from okay to wow a worthless piece of shit that deserve love I see people who have their shit together but here I am 27 and working at a restaurant I wallow in my self pity and I seem to change that,"Yep, I was actually feeling pretty good about myself this morning, but now a total 180 and I think a disgusting freak never going to find love... I hate myself"
I honestly need an answer.. What do you do when you're so down in the dumps and stuck in your own head with revolving negative thoughts over and over and over and over again?  Literally 1 thing that has helped you in the past. Please.,I even put up with bad books. Anything that gets me thinking about something else.
i shouldn’t be allowed to be close to people emotionally. i hurt her  i hurt her  its all my fault  she hates me  its irreparable i hate myself  i shoudnt be allowed to get close  all i do is hurt others  all i do is bring pain,"Whoa, easy. Whoever she is, and whatever you did, chances are not as irreparable as you think. Time will heal most wounds. And if it is really irreparable, then you move on. One incident is not indicative of your worth as a human being, nor does one opinion determine whether you are good or bad. It might hurt to move on, like *really* hurt, but alright. normal."
Bamboo. I bought a bamboo plant from my local chinese store a few years ago when I first started feeling depressed. To this day or is still alive. Just wanted to tell people that I feel proud I can keep something more alive than myself.,"I'm going to buy a few lemon plants and plant them in a cute Groot pot just for this reason.  Btw, have you considered getting a pet? I don't like pets (bad childhood experience with wild dogs) so it's not for me, but generally people who like keeping a plant alive would love to have a happy, living pet around them"
"Does everyone think i hate them?. I recently was hanging out with this girl who said she thought I hated her last year, it hit me kinda hard, I'm extremely quiet and I just wish I could know everyone's opinion of me.",Some people are sensitive. Don't change the good things about yourself just because some people don't understand silence.
"I want a dog.... But I even really take care of myself, what makes me think I could take care of another being. probably end up somehow fucking it up and hating myself more","start with something smaller, like a hermit crab"
Fuck fuck fuck.. Can't sleep.. Have a tremendous amount of restlessness in myself. Just need to fucking calm down,"When I can't sleep I've taught myself to use it. If I can concentrate I read, if I can't I play video games. Anything that helps me to relax. I tend to find that I need to distract myself from being unable to sleep, otherwise it makes me anxious and that makes the sleeplessness worse."
"How can I accept my intrusive depressive thoughts?. Long story short: Was 335, Am 175. Aiming for 130/140ish.  Body destroyed. I accept that. But the intrusive thoughts won't stop telling me I'm ugly and shit. Like I know man, leave me alone.  See the problem is everybody got perfect skin in comparison to me. It uses that. I just want to accept that I'm ugly so it won't hurt when it says it, and then it won't say it.  Any tips?","I think accepting that you are YOU rather than that you are ugly could help. Because you ARE you. You're no one else, and you never will be. You have one body, and no matter how you feel about it, it's all you have. You don't have to like your body at this point, just accept that it is yours.  I just try to accept the intrusive thoughts for what they are: intrusive thoughts. They're intruding. They don't belong in my head. I don't have to listen to them. They can be there, but they don't have to mean anything to me. I'm stronger than they are. I know the truth. They're just trying to confuse me. That sort of thing. The more you can view them as a separate entity from yourself, the easier it gets, in my opinion."
My head is exploding.. All of this.How do you cope with this life?,"Antidepressants, therapy, naps, bubble baths, tea, cat snuggles, books, watching movies curled up on the couch with a pillow and blanket, time spent in nature, a good cry.  Hang in there my friend."
"I forgot what love is. It's been so long. Years. I thought this was supposed to be emptiness, but all I feel is pain. This is no life worth living. I'm so tired","You are not alone in any of that and my heart goes out to you and I think its important to seek professional help for these types of feelings, im sorry i couldn't help more and hope you get better"
I think it's suicide for me tomorrow. No longer have the will to keep going.,"Hey. I know who you are, what doing or even thinking right now, but I do hope that still here for now at least, and reading this comment. really sorry for how feeling right now, and even though been through this for the last 2 years already, I say that I understand how you feel; even though I wish that I could.  But please, please know that if you still need to talk, you could message me yeah? This truly is a really shitty world; but in light of all this, there are still people who are genuinely kind, who would really want to help. Being a beacon of light for those who are still suffering and letting the light from others shine onto you; this the purpose of living? The purpose of still staying here?"
I just wish that I mattered.. I might as well just be gone,Hugs. You do matter. Depression tricks you into thinking the worst.
Any skin pickers?. it's a terrible way I try to cope.,I bite at my nails and the skin around them. My mom gets really mad whenever she sees me doing it :/
All i do is smoke weed and eat a lot. I feel trapped and lonely as FUCK!!,I feel the same. I start losing weight and then I get super stoned get munchies and binge eat and gain it all back and then just feel like shit. almost not even worth smoking anymore.
"Are there any good depression podcasts or online chats?. Went for a walk today and just kept walking for two hours. Would like to listen to something while I do it.  Also looking for good rooms. 7 cups of tea type things, but they went member based and now its shit.",The Hilarious World of Depression is good. Opens your eyes to how many others are suffering that you would never expect.
I just want to have a single person in this world who would care about me. I just want to feel loved.. Is it too much to ask for?,"Hey, if you ever want to talk about anything, I'm here for you. Just send me a message. You're not alone."
"I can't tell people because they'll blame it on my new medicine... Journal helps, but I can't stop thinking about stuff.. Also my uncle was recently diagnosed with cancer and I'm not sure how to react. My parents are acting like it's going to be fine, but they make it sound so serious when describing it and after my grandpa had cancer I'm scared.","Can you add a little more information to your post? It is kind of vague, confusing (as far as blaming [depression?] on new medicine), and hard to comment on."
What will happen if I tell my psychologist about self harm?. First off I'm not even sure what I'm doing classifies as self harm. But I'm scared to let her know about it when I see her tomorrow. What will happen?,you are beautiful. pretty sure i've seen your username before
i dont want to risk staying alive if staying myself forever is one of the possibilities. i dont want to be alone for the rest of my life but i dont want to fuck people over,How will you fuck people over?
"After effects of depression meds. Hey everyone, I've been on meds (cymbalta) for about 6 months and my life has completely turned around since then. I broke up with my ex of 5 years and fell into deep depression where I was contemplating suicide. Went on the meds and my life has turned around completely. The only thing I would like to say is that I can't feel excited, or having feelings of love or connecting with someone. Could that be the meds also? Like I get they take away the lows but I'm wondering if they take away the highs also.",I don't really know if it's the Cymbalta. I haven't experienced that myself when on it. How long have you been on it? Maybe it's still building up?
I just want to disappear. sick of everything. I hate life. I literally fuck everything up. I have anything worth living for. just done. so sad. Nothing matters anymore. Nothing makes me happy. just a failure.  I just want to go away. done. Life for me.,Excuse me while I disappear
Lack of sleep. Did the time change affect anyone else's depression negatively?,Yeah i feel a little disoriented but in a good way lol
its quite an interesting feeling starving yourself for a day. i guess dinner tonight will taste even better :D,"Not so long ago, when I was at my lowest low mentally, physically and emotionally, I didn't leave my bed for about 48-60 hours, just once or twice to pee. The weird thing is that I should've felt starved af but I really didn't, just heard my stomach growl every now and then."
My parents are getting a gun for home defense and I don't trust myself. I don't have the heart to tell them how I feel but I'm terrified of what I'll do to myself. Lol what the hell is wrong with me,They should definitely get a safe that only they can access. No problem then.
"Living feels like hell. I want to die. I want to stop hurting. It hurts more that I go through with it. I have any reason to be sad, either.",I wish I had a reason to accommodate this suffering
I shouldn't be alone.. Starting to feel like it's inevitable. I don't trust myself to be alone.  In Minneapolis.,I feel your inner turmoil and pain. I'm not sure of your age or history but I was married for 14 years (no children) and have lived on my own the last eight. It hasn't been easy. It's not fun. There were times I didn't trust myself alone and I recognized that I needed to take steps to help myself so I sought out therapy and it has been helping tremendously (both the one-on-one therapy and resulting meds).  Do you have a therapist? Do you have access to one? If so I highly recommend going. It's one of those things that carries almost no risk - it can only help.
"What's the point?. I need a reason to go through this struggle every day. Right now I feel like I'm doing it just because that's the done thing (living), not because I have an actual reason to. And that sucks. Takes all the meaningfulness out of joyful things. I've got a job got a house got a partner and friends. But what's it all for?  Why is staying alive such a task?  Why do I continue to do it?","The little things, the small moments of joy, the feeling of fulfillment. Even if you live a life with more sadness than happiness you still had some happiness. Always remember at your saddest that there will eventually be more happiness down the road."
If just one person would call me.... If just one person would call me I might feel a little bit better and change my mind,Pm me if you want to talk
If I know I will be a virgin for the rest of my life and a cute girl will never love me what should I do?. I hope I get to leave this world very soon,"There's nothing wrong with being a virgin. I'm one, too, and I don't feel bad about myself for it. I'm proud of it, actually. Also, I don't understand sexuality probably because of my autism. Remember, it's not a competition. Once you lose it, you can't get it back. There are a lot of other types of love out there than just physical love. I don't understand why people around my age are upset about being a virgin to begin with. Don't feel so negative about yourself. There are people in this world who love you already such as your family. Take care of yourself."
Fuck everything. Fuck me fuck life fuck the world fuck everything,I know how you feel. Everything went to shit for me too.
there's nothing wrong with being selfish when you are depressed. it really isn't. so fuck those people who call you selfish,Not as long as you aren't hurting yourself or others
What the hell am I doing. I'm failing classes. I'm sabotaging relationships with people I care about. I have little to no motivation for social interaction. Literally what the fuck am I doing. I don't think I've reached a lower point than what I'm currently at.,"we on the same boat. havent been going to school, probably already failed some of my classes. theyre just a group of fucking morons anyway. broke up with gf. have no friends. the ones I had were fake. shit."
I've got a november birthday (today) at least I have Guns n Roses. Feels kinda nice listening to november rain when you're depressed on your birthday :),Happy birthday from me to you. It's mine also. I hope you enjoy your day regardless of whatever you do.
"For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction: The more effort I put into finding the job I want, the body I want, the social life I want, the more hurdles and resistance I encounter, essentially countering all my actions + leaving me burned out with nothin to show for 10ish yrs of trying. You're walking out to the ocean but the waves keep pushing you back to shore. I just needed to express this somewhere.","Yet success also occurs. But when it does, it's almost like magic, with barely any effort at all. Luck, some call it. Makes you wonder."
"Do you think some jobs are really meant for people with mental illnesses?. I mean to say that those jobs are only limited to people with depression, just that a good fit Edit: Jobs like being an artist, working in the film industry, therapists, nurses, etc.","Every job you mentioned will have significant pressure, which can lead to more depression. Artist - a friend of mine is a indie musician type of artist. Born in a rich family, great social support with what she does, good education. She accepts that being an artist doesn't bring good money because interest and passion matter more. Still has been clinically depressed for years. Still making meager money. Every person I can think I'd back in college that studied fine arts or art history has rich families so they can continue to pursue a masters or phd in areas they like without worries. For those who don't have a privileged background, starving artists are no cliche - that's the norm. And I think people who are already depressed are unlikely to find poverty to be a good escape. Film - very unstable depending what you work on. Networking is extremely important and you must be socially savvy because it's all about power and money, even in independent films. This means competition and getting funding will be incredibly difficult. Therapists - you need good education and superb social skills and emotional control. A depressed person is unlikely to have the latter. All require years of training. Nurses - I don't need to elaborate more. Just google how many perfectly healthy, capable, and motivated nurses who still got burnt out and depressed. It's long work hours, high pressure and physically demanding to boot. What I want to say is this: any profession will have major shortcoming and sacrifices. There's no such thing as profession that are suitable for depressed people. Any job can turn a healthy person depressed - on the contrary, any depressed person can find recovery by engaging in other professions and become successful."
My therapist: don’t drink or do drugs Me the next week: so I drank and got high. Love a daily dose of self-sabotage,A therapist should discourage anything that fuels your depression/illness
"Why some people actually commit suicide while others spend all their lives only thinking about it?. Maybe it's not true, but i'm trying to understand.",If I knew it wouldn't break my mum and stuff heart I would be dead already.
No one cares for me. I hate myself more than anyone I've ever met.,"Why do you hate yourself OP? We all make mistakes in life. But, we learn from it, grow, and hope to make better decisions moving forward. That's part of life. Is there something that's causing you to feel guilt, or shame? Hope everything turns out okay..."
Do you feel awkward when you have hang out alone?. Do people throw shade at you?,"I'd rather be alone than with people who are mean. Learning to enjoy your own company is difficult but once you get there you're set. Love yourself first, the focus on forming relationships with others"
"I keep myself so busy and try so hard to make other people happy.. Because I know that the second I stop for too long my brain will realise that I'm not really happy. I'm exhausted all the time, but I can never stop because I'll never be able to start moving again.","I think I can only live if I keep myself happy. If I relax, the nightmares come ... :("
"How do I tell my parents I'm a failure?. Failed most classes at uni, I got temporarily dropped cause of that but I'm just scared to tell them..",Just tell them straight up. I'm sure they will understand.
"DAE Doubt their depression?. Sometimes after i go to tumblr and see all these things about people with depression and how they get out of their bed sometimes, and they cry themselves to sleep, it makes me feel like my depression bad enough. I know why.","I know what you mean, I've put off going to the doctors for about a year so far partly because of this... I think it's healthier to contextualise it like this: Is my emotional state effecting my quality of life? Do I constantly put myself down and have low confidence? Comparing yourself to others is a race to the bottom, somebody is always 'worse' off in your eyes because you dont value yourself as much as you do other people, your mind down plays your own successes and overplays others. The hard bit is convincing yourself that is the case, fuck even I'm not convinced and I have some self awareness of why I feel the way I do, it's hard man. Your feelings are real and you dont need to prove otherwise to anybody but yourself."
"Anyone else written a bucket list?. I've written mine, not a lot on it but might as well try to do some of it. When I finish that I can kill myself and be free. That'd be nice. Or I might just give up on this too. Idk... I wish things were different",Whats on your list? Maybe while you're doing it you'll find more things to add
I hate this world and I hate work and I’m unable to sustain myself. I’m awkward boring and weird so everyone treats me like shit and I tried to fix this for 18 years but no result it’s staying. And I’m really tempted about this killing yourself thing. Any alternatives?. Just asking before doing it.,end it man! Go somewhere. Be on your own. Figure yourself out. nobody so broken that it cannot be fixed.
"People with no depression think that time is limitless. After a lot of thinking, I figure that a lot of people who don't suffer depression don't have the sense of time.  There is just not enough time during the day (or year) to get to where you want or achieve what you want. People without depression can be so optimistic to start going to the gym at 40 or start a new business at 50.  Time is very stressful to me, and the optimistic ones seem to live in LaLa land where they think they can get everything done and everything will work out great. Sometimes they shortcut it by cheating or doing so-and-so job to get that promotion",Yeah my life is over already I'm 22 and there's literally nothing I can do to start my life. People keep telling me I am young and have plenty time left for everything. It's just not the case though when you have nothing and never have there is no chance of you ever having anything and having a life.
i keep pushing people away. how do i stop  how do i bottle up my emotions so only my therapist can know things  i dont want anyone else to know how i feel anymore  how do i stop,"You stop by examining your negative habits that you have and changing them, and also committing to yourself to not push people away even when you want to. It's your natural response sure, but you really have to struggle to change that pattern. It's going to take resistance, and you have to have motivation to do it."
"i dont know what to do. So, im about to kill myself but im really afraid about how my boyfriend will react to it. I dont want to make him upset but this is my only option right now, we are both 16 if that changes anything.","What about just fuck it. care about the problems no more? what I did and it worked for me over the span of 3 years. No fucks given, to anything, anyone."
"I'm done. Throwaway   I'm done. I want to actually die. I'm 13M, I have Ibd, I'm getting to sleep, I have a constant headache, my family loves me, and that's why I'm so hesitant to kms. If i knew it wouldn't make them so sad, I'd do it no arguing.","I could understand how awkward IBD might make certain social situations, and I'm sorry you're having to deal with it. Middle to high school are the developmental years, and having to deal with abdominal pains/bathroom runs every single day in that time period is frustrating I'm sure.  With that said, there is just so much to look forward to. While your issues might fall onto deaf ears for people your age, IBD isn't going to be something that's going to prohibit you from living and leading a normal life. Special arrangements can be made for college/work(especially if you're working in a technical field, you might enjoy a mix of online classes) and you're going to find that people are generally more empathetic as you grow older. Hang in there man. I can't possibly know you and what *else* you're going through just with a single throwaway reddit post, but I'd encourage you to talk with your family if you're feeling serious suicidal thoughts. It sounds like they love you and would try to support you :)  Take care"
I'd like to return or possibly exchange the gift of life. I think mine might be defective.,Ah r/depression the only sub positive comments are downvoted to shit
Life is way to long.. I wish it would end already.,"How old are you. Im 29 and im also counting every second, this shit just wont end"
"I'm tired. That's how I feel, not just physically but mentally too. Like the dim screen on a phone with no battery left. I just want to rest, but lately that makes it worse. Why does this feel so bad?",I know how that is. Resting feels like the right thing to do but it never quite works. Have you thought about taking a sleep aid? I take mirtazapine before bed and it makes me sleep better and I feel better the next day. More rested and alert. It is part of my strategy to finally lift my depression.
Im stuck. Anyone else like this?. I am very anti social not any friends and am bad at many things ruining things as I touch them. I dont even wanna try because Ill know ill fuck it up. Why do I even bother,"I can relate. The only place I try is at work, and that takes all my energy. feel like I have energy to do much else."
is it OK to be average?. I hate being average at everything it fuels my depression!,Average is great! At least you don't suck.
"Fluoxetine giving me nightmares?. I was just wondering if anyone else has had any experience with this. They're often very vivid and surreal, it's making not want to go to sleep at night.  Is there anything I can do to stop this without stopping my doses?",I did. The nightmares were so bad I had to stop taking it because I couldn't sleep. A few days after stopping I was able to sleep much better. Unfortunately I'm not sure what you can do to avoid stopping the meds.
Very seriously considering ending it.. I'm at a crossroads and everything feels jumbled. I can't decide by the desire is over taking me.,I'm available as well. I'll even give you my phone number
It'll get better!. Said countless times when it only seems to get worse.,"i feel you m8.. been clinically depressed for like 4 years now, it sound long but it feels like been forever. depression be cured. it can be treated. there are so many neurotypicals that try to tell me i will get better, but thats the only way they know how to comfort people i guess."
Suicide is the only way to end everything. I want to help myself anymore,I use to be miserable. I hated my wife. My life. Lots of stuff.  But one day I just Decided to be happy. I got up. Told by bitch wife I loved her. Kissed her. Got up and sang in the shower. But i was miserable again in an hour. But then the next day i tried again. And the next afternoon. Again and again.  Finally my wife wasnt a bitch anymore. My life wasnt so bad. I realized being miserable can be a choice. Our emotions can be changed by our actions. Wake up and just pretend to be happy. Pretend you like your job. Fail and do it again.
Nothing bad has ever happened to me. So why do I feel so depressed,Nothing bad has to happen to be depressed. Try shaking things up a bit an do something different or new might make you feel better also be glad nothing bad has happened to you that's a good thing
"Anyone else with high functioning depression only truly vibe well with other people with unspoken high functioning depression?. Like having to put on a happy face and be happy but secretly being dead inside, my bestest of friends have always been the people who are concerned with their career and looking taken care of and happy but also internally unhappy","Currently in the middle of this. Don't want to get out of bed. No desire to see other people. Never remember anything. But I have 2 jobs and I'm a student. I don't have a choice but to be high functioning. It makes me hate my depression (because it's inconvenient), leaving me even more depressed."
anyone here a shut in ? (stays home 80%+ time). anyone here a shut in ? (stays home 80%+ time),The only time I leave my house is to go to work or go shopping. I guess that is a shut in.
Everyday is a success.. I successfully manage to not kill myself.,Every victory is well deserved :)
"Have you ever been paranoid of the thought that your girlfriend/wife is cheating on you?. Sorry for any typos, my english is kinda crappy","Yes, worrying about this is normal EVERYONE does it, but you must not let it take over your life. Speaking to your girlfriend/wife is the most important thing, making sure they are happy and making sure you are happy is what is important."
What do you say when people ask you how you're feeling/doing?. When people know you have depression and ask how you're doing what do you usually answer? Do you keep it vague? Do you answer honestly and say you're suicidal (if you are)??,"more often than not, i end up giving a half truth. or, i guess more accurately, a partial truth. when i'm with friends 9/10 they make me feel good and forget about my shit show of a brain. so i answer with good! or feelin' great now! because at the time, thats how i feel. but mostly i leave out how i felt before seeing or talking to them.  that may be wrong or decietful, but i just don't like to burden my friends with this. especially those who can't handle my neuroatypicality."
Anyone else here have Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria?. It makes take any kind of chance or risk impossible.,Truer words have never been written
Just started school again and I can't focus or learn because im really depressed all day and its a negative spiral help me please. title. But yeah its really bad guys,And what's the reward of finishing school? Working full time.
DAE feel like your over self centered for ur own good?. I just find new reasons to dislike myself all the time since thats what im looking for. I am not perfect and somehow uncounsiosly i expect that from myself. Do anyone feel the same?,I'm always focused on myself. Even when people are talking to me- I'm too focused on how they are actually perceiving me than listening to then
"I just had a dream where the girl of the dreams came up to me and I asked her out. She said yes and she told me she loved me. We got married later. Then I woke up.. Words can't describe the frustration and pain in my chest right now.  Edit: It sucks right now because she's abroad right now, she comes back next month. I'm not gonna hold in my feelings anymore, I'm gonna ask her when she comes back.","And this is why I am sleeping like 12 hours a day now. In my dreams, everything is great. Then I wake up and it is like F*ck me, not"
Depressed Mom. Does anyone else feel guilty for being a depressed Mom? It's like as much as I try to connect with my little one's (It could be) I can't :(,Yes I feel guilty all the time. I want to be and do these things that seem simple to others yet I struggle to wake up everyday just to take care of them. I have a hard time feeling a connection to one of my kids and I work really hard to make sure that's not felt by her
"Does anyone else think about redoing parts of your life?. Like going back in time and fixing those shitty mistakes you made. Not even the big stuff, but small things like who you chose to sit next to on the first day of class.  Idk, I've just been thinking about it a lot I guess",Every single day I wish that I could go back 4 years ago. Back to before my mental health went to the shitter. Do things so differently.
Think about your family! fuck off. they're half the reason I'm depressed and want to die.,"Yes, tell them to fuck the right"
I don't even keep track of the days anymore and everything just feels like a blur. Weeks absolutely fly by and I'm staggered at just how little I have done this year and overall accomplished in my life at this point. When I'm alone with my thoughts it really digs away at me. What the fuck am I meant to do on this planet?,"It's the same for me...I can't believe how little I've experienced. There's a part of me that wants to really live rather than just 'existing' but I don't know if I'll ever be able to let myself. I guess if you can take that step and put yourself out there, make each day mean something even if it's only small things etc, you should. But I know it's a lot easier said than done. I don't really have any advice for you, but just wanted to let you know that you're not alone. Maybe volunteering somewhere could help you if that's something that's possible for you...doing something meaningful and giving yourself purpose and all that."
"I feel sick, sad and alone.. my lungs aren't doing well today. my husband works 9am to 9pm so i am alone today. i want to disappear into my story and hide there. i want to be in that other world where i am happy. i feel like a bother to people.","I may just be a random stranger in the internet but you are definitely not a bother.  And, how are your lungs?"
"I don't want to kill myself, I realize the selfishness of that for my loved ones &amp; that I only have one life. At the same time, Im so sick and tired of living, I feel like a zombie. Having to work day by day towards a future Im unmotivated/feel so hopeless for.. sometimes I wish I could start all over.",You can start over. Start now.
I just want this to stop. I just want a hug,you came to the wrong place
Help me. Anyone have any advice for people feeling suicidal?,"Keep the idea of suicide as the last resort in your mind. This is actually quite comforting for me, as I know always an option. Once that is accepted, focus on taking it one step at a time, trying to appreciate each small thing in life. One day, hour, and moment at a time. Stay busy, see friends, remain clean and tidy, and be as kind as you can to yourself."
"Smallest actions seem like the biggest achievements. Tried a face mask today after a long time. I bought those before a big task I had to pass, which I miserably failed. Just opening the packet and using it today felt, scary. But I did it. Anyone else feel this way with small tasks?",I just cried today because I didn't felt like killing myself in the morning... but after that I realized how stupid crying for that it is that I immediately thought of suicide... yay
"I can’t focus!. just so tired and I just focus. I focus, just stuck in my own thoughts. I feel worried, anxious, depressed, I feel a weird uncomfortable feeling in my chest, all my energy is used to keep myself calm, well, I know what to do, wish me luck fellas.",That's quite a common symptoms among the depressed actually. I can relate to very well.
"Most people here FEEL like everyone hates them, I KNOW everyone hates me.. I usually write unnecessarily long texts, so I'll spare you the details.  //alright not *everyone*, but **a lot** of people",How do you know that?
"If it weren't for my wife and daughter, I'd have killed myself by now. I know they need me. The only thing keeping me alive is that I don't want them to suffer. I wish I hadn't imposed myself on them.",I understand completely. If it weren't for my daughter I'd be gone. Right now even holding out for her is very hard. Truthfully if I had a firearm I don't know what I'd do.
"I don't want to go to college anymore.. It's really worthless. I don't know why I should attend to college. Because I'm Asian, living in a pathetic society, ha.","I feel you, honestly beginning to wonder if college is really worth it."
"Anyone else in college with zero friends. Please no bullshit about putting myself out there and all that nonsense. I do. I try. It's just hard when u are depressed, work 40 and then just have nothing to say idk","Not in college, maybe never will be, but at this point I'm not even bothered about being alone, in fact I relish it."
Anyone depressed cause of loneliness?. I just want someone to love.,"That someone will come into your life when you least expect it. I want to kill your hopes by saying that they cure your depression, because they very well could, but they also may not. I will say, that having someone you love and someone who loves you does help. But remember that you have to put so much effort into looking for someone because the right person will show up without you having to try so hard. beat yourself up if you have anyone yet, it takes time of course. Focus on yourself and doing things that you enjoy, things that help pull you away from depressive thoughts. get through this"
Homeless and lost. I'm a mess I've always hated life I feel so empty,Where are you in the world?
"Almost Asked my Crush Out. Learned she has a boyfriend. Great! Glad I didn't pursue, but fuck. Guess I'll move on :'(",A very similar thing happened to me but only the first half. We talked from 6 till 10:30 till the closed. I thought there was a connection but I never ever ever heard from her ever again.
Remeron and nightmares?. Anyone else experiencing nightmares while taking mitrazipine/remeron?,I think most anti-depressants give you nightmares. Both my mom and I take them and we both have horrible nightmares.  You get used to it.
"I miss people noticing me, caring about me, giving me attention etc.. I wake up with 0 messages, nobody messages me first. When my social anxiety developed so far that I didn't want to come outside anymore I lost like 90% of my friends. A month ago I got a psychosis which changed me a lot and made me lose the remaining friends i had. I really miss it that people checked in on me, sent me sweet messages and made me feel like I matter. Every day is turning into a bigger struggle than the day before. I wish I could just find one person to hang out with, share everything with and that makes me feel like theyre atleast happy to see me..","Im not you so Im not going to say that I understand. But Ive been in that sort of situation, similar at least. From the point of view of those who are your friends or family, its really hard to see someone you love in that situation, sometimes they don't even know what to do so they leave you because they feel they are not helping because they dont know how. All i can say is that you will met people that will stay with you and understand at some point but it takes effort and time, it took me some time. I hope i helped... Sorry if i didn't but its like i said before I don't want to talk nonsense if i dont know your point of view"
why the hell won't I just cry now. I actually need to.. The wanting to cry and can't is just getting too much for me now and is making me angry. I just want to cry like proper cry now. Hating today. I find it one of the hardest things about feeling like this. I want to fucking cry.,Don't get way too attached to the external manifestations of your emotions. Can't cry? So what? If you feel sad it doesn't really matter if you have some salty water in your eyes or not.
"I feel like Depression has made me more aware, but with less energy to handle issues.. So basically yeah, I'm not saying depression has made me smarter (lol, if only) But it basically has made me more aware regarding day to day issues going on around me, except, it took away all the energy for me to be able to react.","This has sorta happened to me too. I feel like I'm more cynical and aware, but I feel distant and like the issues don't really matter in the end."
"Hey, I'm bad with words but here. I've never really had friends, but I fell in love with someone, and they used me for personal gain, I'm not antisocial I just care about others more than myself, and the pst week I've been so apathetic I can't eat, can someone help me?",Try to focus on the little things in life that you find joy in. Something I've always struggled with it focusing too much on the big picture and when you do that it often just becomes too much to handle and you get yourself all freaked out.
"Does anyone feel like life is full of mistakes on repeat?. The same foolish mistakes again and again, and each time it's less redeemable and less recoverable.","All it is, building up hope only to watch it dash against the rocks below, day after day. Inevitably."

One thing I will never ever do for sure:. Procreate. Being born is a curse. I hope I die very soon.,"The worst part is seeing people bring life into the world, when they don't have control of their own life."

"Fluoxitine (prozac). Hey I've recently been prescribed fluoxitine 20mg daily by my doctor, I've suffered with depression on and off for over 10ys. I've been taking them for 6 days and I'm still in a lull, I've heard they can make you feel worse before you feel better.  Are fluoxitine any good?","I take zoloft, so I couldn't give you any insight I'm afraid, though I wish I could"
The only joy in life i get is cuddling with prostitutes. the only time i feel human. Normal girls even look at me. Girls hate shy guys.,"There are nice confident people, equating those things are why you can't get laid.  Source: I can't get laid."
Animals are awesome. I go on a lot of walks in the middle of the night and I think I've become acquainted with all the outdoor cats in my neighborhood. I even had one walk with me before.  Nothing feels better than chilling with a random cat on a lonely night.,"Yep, animals are awesome indeed.. So much easier than humans with all their shit hah"
Living is overrated.. I've been getting bored with this whole living thing. I'm sick and tired of forcing myself to smile. I'm sick of feeling nothing. It's all getting a bit old. Things just don't seem interesting anymore. Do you guys feel like this sometimes or is it just me?,Yes. This world was not for me.
"I noticed, that for each day I am out of school in a row, I get gradually more happier and less depressiv.. Currently day fourth and I am relieved im not in school. But soon, I have to go again there, because an stupid law in Germany.",Hey :) what don't you like about school?
Anyone else does nothing all day yet feels tired all the time?. Even reading a book feels tiring,Yeah. I'm perpetually tired. It's wonderful /s  I hate it especially because I'm tired no matter how much I sleep.

No gf ever can anyone relate?. I'm 24 and never had a relationship is there anyone else in the same boat as me if so how do you cope? I feel like I'm alone on this.,Same here. How do I cope with it? Hmm I think I just resigned in getting a girlfriend or better finding 'true love'. I'm just getting sick when I see couples and wish to exit the world.  I read somewhere that you should love yourself first and then love follows along or something like that. It's very hard to me because I feel like a piece of shid. Well atleast I have series and animes to kill my time.
"My dog has cancer. She has cancer in her nose, and over the next few months im going to watch my childhood friend struggle to breathe more and more until the end. Is this all my life is going to be, just watching things I love suffer and die? Whats the fucking point.","I'm sorry to hear about your dog. Losing a pet is a tough thing to go through. Is it possible to have her euthanized? To save her some pain and you some emotional suffering? Honestly, I think that would be best, if it's at all possible. I had to watch my dog die years ago. It still haunts me because of how much she suffered and how little I was able to do to help.  *-hugs-*"
"the people i can’t live without can easily live without me. realized this recently and its fucking killing me, they couldnt give less of a fuck about me and sometimes, they push me to the side so much i genuinely think they just see me as a waste of time, it makes me feel like such a useless burden.","I'm sorry. This is true for me as well. And they regularly remind me. I think we can get through it though. Actually, that's a lie. I hope you can get through it. I'm not going to be able too....."
"Lonely. I don't feel too good. feel non-existent, unimportant and disposable. It's like nobody cares enough to really see what's going on. Everybody expects me to be fine. I don't even know if it's depression speaking or I'm just really, really lonely right now.",i can relate. where are you from?
"Why does depression at times, feel Addicting?. Almost like a blissful state of *This isn't so bad* then, in time your slowly thrusted back into your numb colorless world","Cognitive dissonance: when thoughts and actions diverge, you change your thoughts to match your actions.  In this case, the action is initial actions you take or take because of your depression. We want to justify why we did that, so we come up with reasons to explain the behavior in terms that are wrong but palatable."
no one gives a shit. ...nevermind...no one here would even care anyway. no one cares on facebook or anywhere else. fuck it. goodbye to this shitty fucking world,"If you wrote this, I think that means you still think someone on here would care. And you'd be right."
"I spent my 21st birthday alone. Sister sent me a text, Brother had to be reminded, Dad too, and he shouted us KFC.  Never left the house, either.  I'm not close with my family at all.",Sorry. That sucks. But you can move on from this. Don't let them hold u back. You can and will do it.
Why do people ask if you're alright or good?. Can't tell them the truth so what's the point,most of the time they might do it just to boost their ego or somethingn if you were to spill and explain to them whats wrong they wouldnt do anything i highly doubt they would honestly care its like always saying hello to a person you have known for many years like we just say it to say it we know. If they dont understand it they wont know how to help
"If I keep having to move from the houses of people I stay with, I'm obviously the problem. It just seems easier to end it all, than trying to find another place to live or sifting through the mass of horrible things about me to find the one that's impacting those I live with. I feel terrible.. Why is living so difficult? Why am I so hard to live with? I didn't ask for any of this. I'm not attached enough to living to continue on in the face of such difficulty. I'm fucking trying my best.","I agree with him, people are so hard to live with I went though so many thinking I was the problem. But then I moved in with my SO and found out that I was just living with the wrong people. freaking hard, but keep your head up, you are not the problem."
society trends are making me feel really super depressed?. please share some insight as to snap out of it. I think im not pretty :(,This seems like fishing for compliments...
im sad.. im so sad.because of my situation.im listening to music.,This a huge troll..check his post history.
Is anybody out there. I just feel really shitty and broken right now,"People are generally selfish and inconsiderate. Different people have different ideas of what friendship is, or should be. You are not crazy, they just don't understand your emotional needs."
.. I feel that I belong in this world I feel that my existence is a mistake.,hard to see our impact on society from a single moment in our lives. We downplay our contributions or sometimes we never even know that a small act of kindness affected someone. Or just being around helped them get the the day. Your not worthless or a mistake. Your life matters a lot.
Why the fuck do I have to succeed?. Why can't I just be human for once.,"You don't.  All my life I've scorned going to college because it held no value for me. I plan to become a traveling hermit and live in the wild with a tent or tarp. I consider myself a successful human being because I've cultivated my mind. I've figured things out. I've matured enough to manage my own personality (as in, not being one of those if you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best people).  Stick with what makes logical sense (you don't need to be successful in the graduating and having a high-paying job sense), not what people will validate, because they won't collectively validate everything that makes sense (namely, the idea in parentheses above: the same idea that you don't need to be successful; most people aren't going to validate that, so fuck them). If it makes logical sense that you don't need to be successful in their bullshit sense, go with that, regardless of whether people will back it up. Logic over worthless people's worthless validation."
I hate being socially inept.. I want to interact with my friends but I just can't hold a conversation no matter what it is... watching them give up on you because you're so dull is a very painful fate,I feel you're pain OP. When it comes to texting holding a conversation is like rocket science.
do you compare yourself to others. i've been doing this and it makes me feel bad.,"I do it. A lot of times. But you have to learn that you are special, and, yes, youre not them! But you are better in something. And that thing, is yours. So, you have to learn to appreciate yourself"
I just want..... a friend...... is that too much to ask for? :/,Same its so hard to make one.
There's nothing like sitting alone watching all your friends leaving school to hang out and not even batting an eye at you. I just feel like shit now,it's the worst when they post the numerous facebook photos of them hanging out.
I've never and probably won't have a normal life. A life spent in escapism is a sad life indeed,"normal is an illusion, and nobody's life is as good as they say it is on facebook. escapism is fine, if it keeps you going."
Just cut myself for the first time. I've been drinking and i don't know how I feel,"Ok, how deeply did you cut yourself and with what? If it is bleeding a lot, clean it up, run it under water, don't let the blood dry and go nasty. Pat it dry. Bandage it up, if you can. Also if you have some antiseptic cream, use some of that on it. Don't drink any more for now, maybe try and get some sleep or have a nice bath or shower or watch tv or something so you can calm down.  Please see a professional- a doctor or a therapist or something. Self harm is very serious. I have been doing it for many years, and it is a difficult addiction to break out of. If you feel the urge to cut again, take a deep breath, count to 10. Write your feelings down or draw them out, even if you don't think you're a great artist or whatever. It will help to get the emotions out. Do you have a good friend you can talk to about it? Or a pet or even a stuffed toy? Talking helps. I'm sorry you're feeling this way. Please let me know if you want to talk. You are a strong person &lt;3"
Not a single person texted me Happy New Years.. Not a single fucking person. Feels bad man.,Happy new year!:) I spent my new years eve alone as expected
help me. anyone find anyways with getting yourself together after a breakup,"It depends what kind of things you usually enjoy doing, watching a of something you can really grip to is a option that can help. I hope you can start to feel better soon, even though sometimes it feels like you have no one, there are people out there who if they knew you were hurting would support you. why Reddit is great (:"
"Random and unexpected triggers. You know what's a lot of fun with depression? When you're actually doing OK one day, no negative thoughts, maybe even feel kind of normal, and then out of nowhere some random thing triggers a crippling wave of despair and agony. I go from pretty decent to wanting to ram my goddamn head through a wall for the thoughts to get out of my head. I'm not sure I'll ever be normal...","I feel you. If you ever want to talk, I'm here"
How do i take a break from social media?. kinda addicted to social media even though a lot of the people on there make me feel like shit. I spend about 2 hours a day on twitter. Some of the stuff people say on their makes me feel so bad i wanna end it. But i stop.,"I started by deactivating Facebook. All of it. Give the important people your number, and then just shut Facebook, messenger and insta down. Leave snap or texts for emergencies and basic social upkeep to let people know you're alive. You can even get extensions for your computer browser to block them. Do this for the sites you obsess over. Find a replacement hobby, make a list of things you need to do. Set a time for when you can check social media again so it isn't a never thing to your brain, just a 'you only have this many days left!' Sort of thing."
"How do you deal with the anger?. I get days where angry at everything, mostly angry at myself for being an idiot and I just feel like hitting myself. I know how to handle this it.","I usually do a random marathon run of something, whether it's games, work, hobby study or movies, cleaning etc (there is a whole lot more). Random work or hobby study are not my go-to but it depends on the situation and mood I'm in. Once you get into it's cathartic, but it's getting the ball rolling that is insanely difficult. I usually give up when I fall to start and sleep with anger but it goes away when I wake up."
Laziness or lack of motivation.. How have some of you battled depression related laziness?,"Hi Talk2muchaa,  Lik onus111 suggested, 'feeling like doing something' just does not happen. If you're deeply unhappy with a lack of activity in your life, you just need to force yourself to do it - That's the sad reality of it. HOWEVER, that doesn't mean that there aren't ways to make FORCING yourself 'easier' on your mind and less stressful. If you want to build a house consisting of a 1000 bricks, take 30 seconds a day to lay 3 bricks and in one year, you will have a house.  You can't punish yourself for not building Rome in a day. You will go on Twitch and see streamers who are making millions... YouTubers who are making millions. I mean fuck, PewDiePie has 56 million subscribers.  But that shit didn't happen in just one day. You need to break shit up into increments. Perhaps others don't have to do this. But it's the only way I've found to get anything done. If you want to learn a language, go on Duolingo. Set a '10 points per day' challenge. Yes, it's jack-shit in terms of work. It takes literally 2 minutes a day, BUT- it's something.  Try and ignore your brain saying Increase the goal to 50 a day, we're getting fuck-all done because this will break your discipline and you'll go back to 0 a day.  Consistently doing 10 a day for 11 days, is better than doing 50 a day for 2 days, burning out and stopping altogether. The key to beating depression-induced laziness is TINY, incremental steps. For example, I'm learning Calculus on Khan Academy. One. Lesson. A Day.  That's right- the average Khan video is around 10 minutes. I do one video a day. I am slowly, but consistently learning. Each day I go over the notes from the previous day. The problem isn't volume- it's consistency."
Depression and celebrities. Hey there everyone. I was just wondering how do people feel when they read a celebrity biography and they suffer from depression?,"Not Hollywood per se, but Ned Vizzini suicide hit me hard. now live for real, Craig. Live. Live. Live. I feel many similarities between him and me (same age, etc). A successful author but this disease is just too much sometimes."
Making my bed makes me feel like I have my life under control. I but at least it looks like I do.,I can't get anything done if my bed isn't made. It's the first thing I do every morning.
"I saw a tree full of blooming pink flowers. It was beautiful.. I'm really trying hard to look around and see the good things that are in the world. My life might be in turmoil, my mentality negative, my hopes low... but still, to notice and recognize something as simple as a tree with flowers... that's special.  I just wanted to share.",I love going to forest Parks and looking at all the plants and animals. It helps to a certain extent.
What do you do when you go so long without feeling alive?. I feel like all I need is a kick - some tiny stupid spark - to get going again. And it just never comes.,you sit on the sidelines and watch everyone else pass you by.
help. hey how do i shoot myself in the head without a gun thanks,"Shoot yourself in the face with kindness. Go and treat you some motherfucking chocolate and some fucking videogames and calm the holy fucking fuck down. This was a lot of fucking swearing but even fucking think about killing your damn self. You will leave some fucking people who will for fucking fuck sake miss you. So - as as friendly reminder - please kill you! *You* *matter* ! Never ever think about this again or even post this shit. I want you to stay alive and fucking nail it! You can do it, buddy!"
"I'm winning this battle today. I ordered groceries, pretty much all produce. I WILL NOT let them go bad. I'm doing laundry today. I'm showering today and brushing my hair. I just might even mow my back yard (not likely, but it's fun to dream)  I'm not letting my depression best me today.","Here is a good tip: When you get vegetables and fruit, make a small plan to when you will eat them. That way you won't feel overwhelmed and take the easy route.  I planned on eating an apple a day and physically assaulting every person with a labcoat that I see on the streets and so far my plan has worked wonderfully! I slapped so many doctors!"
"Post-suicide Questions I Wanted to Ask. I started writing my letters today and I wondered how people would receive them if they were electronic. These letters arent really something I can handwrite in a timely manner without having the courage to keep writing.  Do the police access the computer and shift through the belongings to find the letters or wouls I have to send them out myself to have them delivered? What happens to my belongings? If I lock myself in a nonshared dorm room and kill myself, how long would it take to find my body and who would be responsible for cleaning it up? Would it leave my family in debt? Would blowing my head off or hanging myself leave my body in a state where it's unusable for a funeral?  I'm turning 20 in 2 months and I'm just too tired. Id like to finally be able to rest and not have to live a conitant life of fear and sadness. As much as I do not want to keep living this kind of life, I am too tired to keep pushing through any longer and I'd just like for my death to be somewhat feasible for my mom and sibling.","the thing, though, your death be feasible. Your mom and sibling would spend the rest of their lives wondering if it was something they did or said that pushed you over the edge, or thinking about what they could have done differently to be there for you. One of both of them would likely spiral into a depression of their own. I used to think that no one would miss me much if I killed myself, but always remember the sound of my brothers voice when he found me with blood pouring from my arm. That something that you can just get over. Even leaving notes really help the pain for your family. Also consider the suffering of the people who found you. It could be an RA or a dorm mate. They would be traumatized for life, with severe PTSD from seeing a dead, decomposing body. That point would be too late for you to do anything, so we try not to let it go that far. get me wrong, I know where coming from, and not trying to make you feel bad for would be wrong. And clear from the fact that even thinking about these things that you have some reservations, so build on that. Take every little good thing that happens to you and imagine never feeling that way again, and imagine robbing the people you love of those feelings as well. Forgive me for being brash, but there is absolutely nothing delicate or glorious about suicide. The people who experience it secondhand go through ten times the suffering of the people who commit it. Please, for the sake of a stranger on the internet who cares about you, think again. There is hope out there, even if everything seems hopeless right now."
"My moms reaction. My mom knows I'm nearly suicidal and I suffer from OCD, Bi-Polar disorder, severe anxiety, and depression (yay) and her reaction to me ever telling her anything is either A. Do I need to take you to the hospital, or B. that's life. Bruh,",People know how to handle it. blame them.
What helps you lighten up your mood when there's nothing you wanna actually do?. Do you just force yourself to exercise or something?,Everyone suggests to exercise but its easier said than done when one feels this lethargic and hopeless. One thing i can say that works for me when im feeling this way are youtube meditations called solfeggio frequencies it subliminally lifts your mood and vibrations upon listening. Very cool amd its my go-to right now.
"I just want someone to ask me how I'm doing without me provoking the question.. That's it, that's all I have to say.","Me as well. Most of the time when its asked they just expect a good or a fine but if you are genuine they just seem uncomfortable...  I would ask how you are doing, but it was provoked by this post lol. If you still feel the need to talk, I'm here :P"
"am I the only one who feels like this?. I feel like I wanna be left alone and runaway, delete all social media , give up etc... but at the same time wants to be more involved and try to succeed but just for some reason i can't find the motivation..","Minor problems can become major very quickly. The earlier you start addressing your issues, the better your chance of recovery."
I'm so tired. I'm so incredibly tired of living. Waking up every day and having to feed myself and take care of myself is so exhausting. I'm just tired of life,People just tell you go to bed earlier. They can't fathom how much effort it takes to drag through every dull day.
People keep saying we should fight our problems no matter what. but why?? What's the purpose of doing that?,That's the million dollar question. But I'm only fighting my problems because I'm scared that if I die I would hurt people
I’m so lonely. Help. Please.. I know how to handle this,"Well, we're all here because we've been in the same place one time or another. I, myself, find it hard to believe that it gets better. But, there's always this tiny ray of hope that says just, JUST, hold on for a little longer. And since I've got nothing better to do, I obey."
anyone else feel like they cant do anything?. I just feel like there's nothing that i'm good at. I want to be good at doing something but i have no skills when it comes to the things i wish i could do.,I feel the same way. unnerving to live in a world with so many talented people who do meaningful work and are achieving so much whereas I can do nothing but watch
"If you do something long enough, it rewires your brain. That's both of good and ill. I know certain habits and crutches just encourage the depressive and anxiety feelings. But as I try new things, new therapies, they become less scarry and more normalized. So there's always hope.",Care to extrapolate on some positive examples of your brain rewiring? The only experience I have with this is my weed addiction since I was 16 and now I'm 20 :/. Only smoked once this last week tho so things are looking up
"High school has robbed me of my freedom. My schedule is filled with being forced to study things I already know its painful. Last week I only had 2 hours where the sun was up and I did what I wanted, and Im not a bloody owl, Im being a prisoner in this endless cycle of bullshit.",High school is incredibly strict. I suggest dropping out of any AP courses you may be in and taking early -college courses instead. They're much easier and by FAR more worthy of your time.
"Please tell me that it’s gonna be okay.

"Tomorrow, you will feel better.. That's what I heard yesterday. Stop saying that!","I have no idea what tomorrow will bring. The other day my mom made an abrupt prayer about hoping the family will survive, as in not die, this year of 2019. I hoped no one would commit suicide because I am already suicidal."
"I know this doesn't matter much but.... Why in the seven hells is everyone so damned angry today?! I have done nothing to deserve it, yet... Maybe today has some bad karma. I hope all of you at least had a better day than me. If not, maybe tomorrow.",Fuck today. Go back to bed!
so hopefully with me not drinking i will get better. maybe my paxil will work.. maybe not  who knows,"Iam hoping for the same thing. I make stupid decisions when I drink. It was a great coping mechanism for my thoughts. Except, it actually wasn't. I have relapsed several times. If you are like me and make questionable decisions when drunk then at least that is how your life gets better. It is just getting to sobriety takes effort."
"I wish something good would happen. not that I sat and waited. done everything I could think of, that was worth a try. not gonna be ok.",Wish and hope work sorry sorry just brutal done everything you have to try again. Fail forward they say. Yes it sucks I know.....
"I feel like I have to adapt to people?. I feel like because I have a caring heart, I can't show it and have to adapt to other people's cold behaviour. What do I do?","don't.  This is just an advice, my way of looking at things. I believe that you are not surrounding yourself with the right people, but it's true that most of the times we don't really get to choose who we meet. Having a caring heart is nothing to be ashamed of, and it would be a pity if your kindness gets lost in the midst of the crowd just because you want to fit in. There are a lot of people like you, that I can assure you, so as long as you are at peace with your thoughts and with who you are I'd suggest you should keep on being yourself. Take care (:"

How do I deal with the feeling that someone is better then me?. Do I just accept it? Any tips?,"better is so subjective.

I saw this on this sub but my turn to stop being a depressed teen.. And be a depressed adult instead.,I think it's necessary to have a sense of humour. Usually it's a morbid humour :) my ability to joke actually increased a lot after I started suffering from depression.

Weed is beginning to not even help anymore. What do I do now. never mind. it's all irrelevant,"Same. I get a weird feeling in my chest and it gets hard to focus. Which is weird because I loved it for 2 years before it started happening, I was known as a stoner and I loved being one. Now I try and avoid it. It gave me some amazing memories I'd love to relive but I just can't smoke without having the weird feeling happen, literally the smallest amount can make me feel weird."
A great time to have an off day. It's 5 p.m. and I've only left my room for a cigarette and a bit of yogurt. I think the worst part might be that no one has actually come up to check on me.,"Loneliness is a terrible thing. Even if you're alone, that's not necessarily a problem.

Made it through another miserable day at work today without killing my self idk how I do it.. Will it ever get better?,"That is the question we all ask ourselves. But if you feel that you hit rock bottom, it can only go up from there."
I'm finally on medication and found a therapist who makes me feel hopeful for the first time in years. It has been a while since I've felt sincere hope.,im envious of the fact that you want hope
"If I wanted to kill myself, no one would be here to stop me.. I'm constantly depressed and everyone is always busy.","I feel the same. I do my best to push through every day and hope tomorrow will be better and it never is. Please don't do it. If I'm still here, you better stay too."

Im a really shy introverted person, but i had multiple people telling me that i came over as real angry threatening dude with a frown on my face and i never noticed this in my entire life. So, you need to be confident in yourself, showing through body language that you are a good guy to hang out with, i simply cant say how to do it, but thats one way to explain this."
Being heartbroken sucks. I was dumped on the 1st of December 2015. Still healing. I go to school with my ex. See her every day. I feel so alone. I don't know .

I know it sucks really hard, and I can't say it gets easier, but I know there a LOT of other people feeling the same thing, including me. Hang in there man, it's the most you can do."
"Does anyone else get really cruel thoughts spontaneously?. For example, I can just be at school and I look at a single person I don't know and just will imagine them either being killed or having a cruel scenario happening to them.  I wouldn't do anything I imagine, but those thoughts are purely random and uncontrolled.",Since kindergarten at the least. funny because I am a rather gentle person.
"I'm depressed. So 3 days before Christmas I found out that I was a mistake. My mother was on birth control and obviously it didn't work because I'm here. I ask myself, Why is my mom such a bitch to me?, I know why now.","I feel yah. I was a mistake too. Just know that you're not alone, and that being a mistake doesn't mean you're worth less than anyone else."
idk why im still alive. i guess ill jump off a bridge next week,"You've probably heard this before- that you should try improving your quality of life and see how that works. But I know how it can feel like nothing will ever change. So I propose that in order for you to prove things can't get better, give your life the absolute best shot you can give instead of giving up on it now. This way, you can *prove* to yourself and others that you're beyond saving, and the bridge will become a more reasonable option. It's a fucked up way of motivation, yes, but it motivates me"
"What is something that gives you hope?. For me, it is music. Something about it just washes all of my problems away, and makes me feel like I`m on top of the world.  So, what about you?",The fact that I'll die xD
"Sometimes I wonder if I really even have depression. I was diagnosed 2 or 3 years ago by my family doctor, who prescribed SSRIs \(which I never took\). My moods range from suicidal and self harming to just feeling out of sorts and not at peace with myself. Sometimes I go months without feeling like that, sometimes it seems to come about every few weeks and lasts for weeks at a time.  I don't know, I sometimes compare myself to my boyfriend who has a team of psychologists and psychiatrists working to diagnose him, whereas I just went to my family doctor, filled in a questionnaire, and boom got labelled with depression. I wonder if I'm faking it or blowing my feelings out of proportion, especially comparing it to more serious cases of mental illness.  Does anyone else ever feel this way? How do you deal with it?","Just because you don't or can't have access to that level of mental health care does not mean your own mental illness is any less valid.  I have always had a team, a prescribing doctor, therapist, and GP. Sometimes specifically a team that works together, sometimes just doctor's that kind of share notes but don't ever meet up. I am very lucky. Very few people get this level of treatment. Any number of genuine suicidal thoughts is too many. Everyone gets depressed, but when you stay there long enough to consider life actually painful to live you have depression. It can be really hard not to play mental illness Olympics. But someone else struggling more does not take away from your own struggle. Your feelings, your illness, are real. They're valid. They have NOTHING to do with anyone else's struggles. Just as theirs has nothing to do with you. Please please please remember that."
"Does anyone else find meditation completely useless?. I'm not denying it works for some, but as someone with depression and crippling anxiety it's basically a complete waste of time.  Anyone else?",Yep same here. Tried a whole bunch of different ones over time.
"Drunk now. So I'm drunk while writing this on my phone but trying to make readable. This girl broke up with me back in late December. Before that happened I was pretty depressed but pretended I wasn't. That's basically what ruined things between us. Since the break up I've been trying to clean myself up. Every once and a while I get up and feel so sad that I want to kill myself. But like now, I'll just get drunk and pretend like I'm okay with this pain. I don't know. I feel so destroyed when people tell me to get over her when she was the one that showed how beautiful live could be. Fuck. I sound like such a romantic. I wish I could just force myself to make me a death trap. Thinking about my guinea pigs makes me want to live so that I can take care of them. I'm so fucking sad. Wish i was in a worse position because I feel like a shit head whining while other people are actually trying to live. Thank you bye",Feel free to Pm me Ive been through almost the same thing and overcame it
"I just wanna eat eat eat, and eat until I explode right now.. I'm hungry as fuck, and uncomfortably depressed. Let me see if I can balance this shit out.","I can't seem to eat healthy amounts of food. Either I overeat to the point of feeling like throwing up or I don't eat anything all day. Seems like the worse I'm feeling, the more extreme my eating habits become."
".... I desperately need aid in this instance of my depression, to handle it. I'm already in an severe episode and what's coming is different, it feels much darker.  Please, help.","Just do your best man. going through dark times (probably the worst of my entire life), just keep trucking on."
"My dog just died, I feel like shit.. I miss him, the only thing that loved me unconditionally is now dead. I miss my smoke buddy I couldn't save him. I wish I could. I'm feel so lonely. All this plus my depression I don't what to do.",Im so so sorry for your lose! *big big hugs*
what do you do when you need love and support but your family is neglective and you don't have any friends?. I feel so lonely it's hurts ....,"Talk to someone online, it's sometimes much easier to get friendly with on the net, there are a lot of lonely people there. When I'm feeling down and there is literally no-one there to talk to it helps me to engage in come conversation in open hobbyists communities. Even having fun chat about anything at all (not a support/getting it out of your chests talk) can make all the difference when you don't have anyone else to talk with. The additional benefit is possibility to get motivated to do something new and interesting. It might not be a substitute for talking with a real friend (online or not) about your feelings but if you are so lonely it hurts it's still something."
The very last things that gave me pleasure are now indifferent to me. i want to die. internet and porn are not an option for me anymore. i've hit a complete apathy. why the fuck is this happening to me,"I have this problem recurrently so I keep a wordpad document on my desktop of things that give me even the slightest bit of pleasure. If you want, I will PM that list to you."
Pristiq. Anyone have experience with Pristiq or Desvenlafaxine.,"Pristiq improved my anhedonia a ton, but sent my anxiety through the roof. It's also anticholinergic, meaning I got side effects like dry mouth and weight gain. So if all you have is depression, it could be a good treatment, but you have to watch out for side effects."
I think I'm returning to being intimidated by women. And I just overcame this phobia at 25. Guess it didn't last long.,edited because it wasn't the most uplifiting :D.  The point i was kinda getting at was looking at things in the big picture usually helps me
I'm just having a bad day. It will get better tomorrow/next week/ next month/ next term/ next year. Spoiler alert: It fucking doesn't,"It really doesn't.  And I feel that the older I become, the less likely that things will actually get better. When I was younger and receiving medical help, there was still the general feeling that I'd eventually grow up and things would be sorted out. Having recently summing up the determination to see a shrink again, I get the feeling that nothing much can be done. I even wonder if I actually have depression. If my life is full of shit, am I really supposed to feel anything but misery?"
"Contact. There's a weird comfort in connecting with someone who you know is also struggling. It's almost like you stare at each other and immediately think, We are on the same team. It's pretty nice.",I totally agree. That's why I visit this sub a lot. It's nice to know you aren't alone.
"Wellbutrin XL and Psilocybin. I have been taking Wellbutrin for my depression. (150 mg. of XL) for about 3 months now. It seems to have helped, a little. So I'm wondering if I should ask my doctor to increase the dosage to see if it helps, a little more. Has this helped anyone else? If so, how can you tell how much of an increase you need? Will taking it at different times of the day help instead of an increase in dosage? Say 75 mg. in the AM and 75 mg. PM? Also, I am curious about micro dosing with Psilocybin for my depression (magic mushrooms). I've read a lot of interesting and positive results from people using it for depression. I'm curious if anyone with depression has experience with Psilocybin while also taking Wellbutrin, and if so what was the affect? Also, has anyone stopped taking their Wellbutrin *completely*, in exchange for micro dosing with Psilocybin?",52 and never used street drugs but Id be first in line to try mushrooms if there was a trial or if they become legal. I think they should be handled with care tjo.
Does anyone else feel like they're no ones first choice?. Popped up in my head and don't go away...,"Life is a series of choices. Many of the people you involve yourself with are not your first choice either but life. If talking about romantically speaking then sure why would anybody be anybody first choice? The culmination of our personalities, looks, intelligence, sensitivity, etcetera, all create true love and attraction. I know come to Love my wife as much as I do but with time I began to learn more about her every day and now I trade the world for her. Being first always the best."
"Had 4 tests today, stayed up till 4 and got up at 6:30 to study and I failed all of them. I don't know why I even try anymore.","Hey, you tried and you should feel proud of that, I'm still trying to motivate myself to at least try because I'm so afraid of failure.."
I have a project due tomorrow and nobody wanted me in their group. I'm either too slow for other people or my mind is too distracted to focus on anything productive.,same even though i said gonna do everything no one wanted me
"When you've been suicidal for a long time, you start to understand that it's not that easy... I fucking want to kill myself but everytime I think about how I failed the previous time and how this method will be pointless. I miss the old me that would've tried to jump in front of a train. Kind of a funny thought relate ?",I find myself theorizing about suicide pretty often (never actually tried ) and I always wonder what would be the best way : I live in Italy so I can't get access to a gun hanging or cutting my wrist sound super painful and u read about the guys that have to clean after people trow themselves in front of trains and I don't want to be a dick
Fuck the people who try to make you feel bad for wanting to go to the hospital for being suicidal.. I was questioned by a CPS worker by the words: do you feel about your siblings knowing that you went to the The intention was obvious and he was clearly trying to make me feel bad for choosing to go to the hospital because i was having a nervous breakdown and that i was suicidal. Even my parents tried to make me feel bad. What the hell is wrong with getting help? They just make you feel bad. Fuck family members theyre toxic asf,"You did the right thing. I respect that you got help to save yourself. Takes a lot of balls.  You can't choose family. I've got only my mom since 11. I don't have an uncle or aunt who hang out with me. You can choose your friends and to me friends are more important. They kinda replaced my family. And it's horribly wrong when people ask you those questions I'm so mad right now fuck man That guy has 0 empathy. I know you mad af but after you calm down try to look forward and hold onto yourself. You don't need them to save you. They should be supporting you, if not then not. Don't give a shit about them. It's a beautiful world but some people have 0 empathy. I may sound cringe but empathy is something I learned with 3 or 4. I don't know what is going wrong with some people"
The only person who noticed that something was wrong was I guy I just met.. I was at a party with my friends at one of their friends places. I became EXTREMELY depressed after having a couple drinks. Basically I wanted my life to be over. I was ready to walk outside and get hit by a car. I became very isolated. None of my friends came to my side or even seemed to notice me. But the host of the party came outside and asked me if everything was alright. It was completely insulting that these people I've known for over 10 years didn't come to my side. It was a guy who I knew less than 5 hours who noticed something was wrong...,"I know it isn't always possible, but you could try and hang out with other kind of people. I was in a group where I felt really bad because all of them were really judgemental and not close at all. After some time I've started hanging out with a group where I feel really motivated, they're crazily fun and accept me. Best of wishes man :)"
I dream of suicide. It's all I can think about at the moment.,I had a dream a while back that someone had a gun pointed to my head and I told them to to pull the trigger because they would be doing me a favor.....
"Stuck in a rut. I was ill for 2 weeks, couldn't get in to college. I'm ok now but I just don't have the willpower to get out of bed. I need to go in but I'm just too anxious over it.","Hi there, I hope you're feeling less ill now. Is there something enjoyable that you can get out of bed for? Perhaps a coffee date with a friend taking the same class as you? The walk to class may be less daunting, plus said friend may even lend you notes for the sessions that you've missed."
Doing literally anything feels like an ordeal.. All I do is sit on the computer or lay in bed because that's all that doesn't feel painfully hard to do. I can't do anything or move on with my life.,"I'm right with you, for years. I bought a VR headset because I needed to use vacation from work. I only put it on for 10 min in 7 days off. I just slept and watched the odd video. I wish I had the energy to feel what I used to from games. It was my only real escape."
Fuck life I want tô die. That is it  Everybody lies and if they dont lie i feel like they are because thats what they usually do so fuck this shit  Fuck girls even more they just make things worst,It's hard for me to believe my family because of all the lies ans omissions they have made in the past. I just learned to be more gaurded and pessimistic.
Life is not worth living if there's nothing to enjoy. Fuck anyone who says otherwise,"Thanks, my depression is cured."
it's too much. i can't take it anymore,You aren't alone here. What's going on?
Learning disabilities.. How do you guys feel about people with learning disabilities?,"They're no different to anyone else, they have their own battles to overcome just like we have ours with depression, etc."
I was gonna as my crush that I’ve liked for 5 yrs to prom..then I find out she already has a date. I wish I a worthless irrelevant piece of shit,"I'm going to sound mean, but I get so tired of hearing this. If you like someone, say something. Don't just like them for years and years, then get upset or feel bad when they get with someone or someone asks them out. I know it's scary and rejection hurts and a million other things, but if you don't say anything, how in the world will someone know your feelings for them? Plus, if she was really your friend, if you asked her out or something, and she stopped talking to you or humiliated you for that, then she wasn't a good friend, anyway, and you'd be better off without her. And you shouldn't try to decide if you're good or not for someone else, only they know that."
"Wrong Planet?. Does anyone else feel like they just were not designed for this world? Does anyone feel like they can love so many people, but that no one who will live you. Because broken and abnormal?","Its my very first time here or any other thread or resource, this is why ill pursue a hand in this issue so thank you. It is the first i read literally and it made me realize im on the right track thinking about support. i feel this exact way every single day isolated, like this world works for some people but i am not able to function in it due to defect of my own and that maybe for me my birth was an error. Its been 5 years or so since i can detect the actual time i started this trajectory and since i lost my job and my life. Traded a career in healthcare for a career in bag chasing."
i just spent the last hour or so crying my ass off.. my upper lip's gone stiff and numb. i feel like throwing up. i don't feel like i can survive tomorrow.,"You know I felt like that last night. Like I was actually trying to find efficient ways to kill myself because I had to do shit from 7:15-6, but here I am. You can do it too. I know it sounds like I'm just some happy guy who doesn't really understand, because I alwaysk ind afeel like that. The words are so simple, you can do it too. All I know is that last night, if I had the oppurtunity I would be dead. Do you need somebody to talk to? GOD I fucking hate how generic all this shit is. I just need you to know that I mean this shit."
"Writer with a quick question. Hi! I'm a journalist, looking to interview relatively recent grads on their experience losing the counseling services that had access to in college. PM me if you're interested - I can provide more details. I'd love to chat.",There aren't that many threads here though. Sometimes it just depends on the time it's being posted (or the title).
Too tired to be depressed?. Anyone else just so tired and bored of being deeply sad that just a chore and rather just lay there and feel nothing but some bursts of sadness and then just complete blankness?,"Yep, for me, I go from crying my eyes out and feeling sad as hell to suddenly a 'wtf, I'm too tired to care' numb state."
"Does anyone else feel nothing at all constantly?. My therapist wants me to think more positively, but I don't know how. I genuinely feel nothing at all 24/7.",Try it. It feels like
I am done in.. This is my 5th relapse. What's the point. My life just revolves around hoping I don't have a relapse. Then I do. I put my loved ones through hell. Is this living? Is god having a laugh? Or is it my brain having a laugh at my expense.,"It's more of a learning experience, is what it sounds like to me. No one is laughing at you, I don't think your brain is laughing either. It just a phase that you're going through. Hope that helps."
"what happens if you take 6 clonidine (catapres) tablets?. one question, what happens if you take 6 clonidine (catapres) tablets?","How many milligrams are each tablet and how much do you weigh? If you're looking to kill yourself, clonidine can't kill you. Just put you in a coma. Which will only make the suffering worse. Please do not attempt suicide using anything. It's Christmas, man. You can reply to this if you need to vent or anything, I'm here for you dude. Again. Don't attempt suicide. Please. For me. A stranger on the internet who cares more than you think."
My dog is the only reason I haven’t ended everything.. I just imagine leaving her.,I want to give my cats a good life that's what keeps me going.
Give me some insane ideas that will make me feel better. Something that other people won't/can't do.,Say toy boat three times fast
I'm not sure what makes me happy I haven't felt true happiness in so long I probably wont even recognize it when it comes to me.. It feels like a trap,"That is what I thought myself at one point in my life but I was wrong. I took a trip with some friends to Malaysia and Thailand there was high and low points in the trip. The experience I felt was pure happiness and no joking the last time I felt this was when I was a child happy and alive. I noticed what is good and bad in my life, and realized the blessing that I did not notice. It gave me positive momentum even after the trip. Now I am trying to finish my studies and now started seriously training in thai boxing. Recently my psychologist told me that my depression is gone (I can feel the difference) and my anxiety and stress remains high. I made big progress and I am going to make more progress.  Basically from my experiences go out and explore. First reflect on your strengths/potential, your interests and the world, then start thinking the necessary steps to live it, even the smallest thing. I sincerely wish you the best. And explain your current situation?"
"Why is it depressed, suicidal people are told to get help. What if some people are better off dead, and their immediate surrounding world would be better off without them?. Maybe it's an evolutionary thing","They tell you to get help because they don't know what else to do. If they tell you to go on with your suicide, and you do, they don't want that guilt in their life. But if they tell you to get help and it actually works, they can feel good about having helped someone. Helping a depressed person is kind of tricky if you don't really know what depression is like. I usually just let them know that they're not alone and I know what it's like."
When did you know that you were depressed?. What were the factors leading up to your diagnosis?,Was never diagnosed. (I would say that being suicidal is a pretty good sign though.)
"Even when you try, it always end in the same way. Does anyone here end up alone always? I mean, even when i gave the best of me and got a lot of people around me and a girl who liked me, somehow i ended up being alone again.  Hahahahaha. I'm such a fucking mess","For me it's not just with girls, but with my career pursuits. I've recently had to stop attending classes on campus because of this and I hate every second of my new situation."
How do you make yourself eat?. I can't make myself eat,"Put some food out on a table you walk past often and each time you wall by, take a bite."
How do you know if you have depression?. I think I have clinical depression and social anxiety. I really don't want to see a therapist until I have things mostly confirmed.,"If you think you have it, you probably do. If you see a therapist they'll give you pretty much the same questionnaire that you can find online. I recommend seeing a therapist soon. The diagnosis isn't really important, if your mental health is affecting your ability to live a normal, happy life, then you need to see someone. Good luck."
"Luv my mum too much to leave her or let her goto a fucking nursing home. But my luv life is dead, what can I do?. I 38,have a home, no mortgage and a ok job. My mum is old and she stays with me so i can look after her. I dont want her to pass ever! but damn when i go out its hard to find a woman who's accepting. Im asian and its part our culture, but i live in australia and i find its a big no no, they always says its sweet but they always leave :( it really bums me out cause i understand where they coming from, i was never insecure about it. Family is important especially your mum. But after couple year mum's still going strong :) but i admit i feel a little resentment. Just trying to get rich now feels like the only goal, so i can get my mum a home carer and another house I might be too old to find someone by that time :'(","I ran a business for 7 years, *you cannot believe the stress it is*. You absolutely must have all your ducks in a row before you run a business. Your ego gets caught up in it, so when it is having rough times you feel like crap, and when it's doing well you need to use that to prepare for when it inevitably isn't.  It can be done, but it's expensive in terms of money, your sanity, health and any relationships that might otherwise happen (however unlikely).  I wish I never tried myself."
Life sucks so much. I wish there's simple way to end it.,"I wish the same. A simple, pain-free way out."
Sometimes i think that i can fly. And other days i can't get out of bed. There's any way to feel better more times? Everything looks so futile...,I know that when everything seems futile to me it's time to make some serious changes in my life. make changes and don't settle with an unfulfilling life.  You only feel like you can fly because you know all too well what's it's like to be depressed and stuck in bed. without the lows we could never know the highs
Can Prozac make things worse?. I feel worse than I ever did before I was officially diagnosed. only been a couple months.,Yes! Antidepressants that right for you will fuck you up. Prozac and Lexapro were both bad for me.
What is the easiest way for a 16 year old to get help ? I live in France. I can give more details if you need,"Get help in what way? It's also cool to see someone else my age on here. Well I suppose not cool, it sucks that you're on here and I wish you weren't, but you know what I mean. I hope whatever it is you need help with gets better"
"I want to be social and meet better people but I can barely care to form words and sentences anymore.. I'm sorry... I want to say more but I can't. It's too hard. This is too hard. How do you guys do this. God I'm so lonely, lifeless and incredibly miserable.",Maybe you're going through an existential crisis. Have you ever thought what the meaning of your life is?
"Killing myself one cigarette at a time. Cause why the hell not, its the only thing that helps me gets through the day and sooner or later it'll kill me. win win.","me too, I can go without quite easily, but I choose to smoke like a chimney because at least it provides some sense of calm."
"Having a severe existential crisis. Honestly, I don't know how to solve this problem, it's ruining my life because I don't want to do anything anymore knowing that it is all meaningless. Is there a way out of this place or do I simply accept that I don't matter?","I've gone through an existential crisis as well. There is a lot of enlightening advice out there to help you through it. Try reading Peter Wessel Zappffe's writings and Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl. If nothing else, try to find a purpose. In my own experience, existential crises don't just go away. You've got to confront them head on. Force a change, create a mission for yourself. The worst thing you can do is nothing, and succumb to the negative feelings that come with the crisis. Attack it with whatever you have."
"i feel worthless. For the past 2 1/2 weeks I stayed home, mostly in my room and go out nor did I do anything. I just lay in my bed and either on my phone or I sleep.   I feel worthless and I want to die","man you're a great artist, you got raw talent. join some art club or something or maybe some art related groups in social media. talk to people and get their perspective on things or how they see life. this will genuinely help you. human is a social animal, man if i lock up myself in my room even i'll feel lonely. how about you go to some nearby park and sketch people or trees, you could initiate conversation or atleast improve you skills and remove boredom"
I can't believe this is me. I just can't believe this is my life,Right? Where's the reality where things aren't so muddled up.
I wanna cut but I’m scared.. I just wanna die but I So I wanna cut and i I feel like not strong enough?,Do you have any close friends you can trust? If so tell them how you feel and if they're your friend they will you help you through this. Also don't think you're not strong enough to cut yourself. Your strong because you haven't. Sending positivity your way. Also I upvoted your posts to help your karma. Not much but I do what I can!
My only goal at the moment is to make it through the day without crying.. not doing very well at achieving this goal.,I'm sorry for your pain. Wanna talk?
Need advice. Hey im going through allot at the moment with my depression and whats going on around me. have been doing harm to asking to help but there is something on my mind that i need to get off my chest and i dont know how to go about it.,"Sure, I might be able to give some advice. What is on your mind? Feel free to PM me or to reply here. Whatever you are more comfortable with."
At the end of the day nobody really gives a shit.. I feel so fucking alone.,So fucking true... Nobody does.
"This is tiring. I'm tired of everything at this point and I know it's not going to go up from here. Why the hell am I going to deal with 10,20 more years of this I'm always going to be trapped in my head and fucked up.",Why do you feel it's not going to get better for you?
"Do you ever have those moments where you wish to be a kid again? Someone purely id-driven with no worries or no burden to carry?. Although I will admit that I had a pretty troubled childhood, more or less ... there comes those days where I really wish that I was a kid again .   During those times, I was purely id-driven. No fear of the consequences. No worries about anything. Nothing to fear about the weight of my actions. there comes those days where I do try to re-inact those feelings, but somehow, I do feel guilty for doing it. So guilty, as if I did something extremely wrong. And because of that ... I feel like I am stuck in a loop of some kind. Wanting to be as id-driven as a kid or wanting to be a boring adult with no fun, no ambition, no nothing",I wish I was a kid again so I wouldn't need reasons to smile
Who else comes to this sub just read about other people problems?. I hope life gets better for everyone.,This sub is the only thing I can relate to
"I no longer see a point in living. I have no friends, no goals, nothing that I aspire to be, and nothing makes me happy. I see myself as a complete waste of human life. I just do not see the point to life anymore.",Is there anything that brings you happiness?
why don't you smile?. why do i have to smile all the time?,I've been asked this since I was a kid. I've always given pretty much the same response whats there to smile about? Surprised I didn't get put in therapy as a kid for saying that shit lol. What I meant by it tho was why would I be smiling at this very moment nothing good just happened
"The only time I feel at least somewhat at peace is when I'm sleeping.. I find myself sometimes napping for no reason. I will wake up and then try to fall back asleep just because I don't want to face the day. And even then, it's not usually that great because I'll have torturous fucking dreams. It takes me forever to get going on mornings that I'm not working. Having time off over the holiday break has been totally miserable. I just feel more and more like the symptoms are manifested during weekends/days off because I have been able to sleep in, so I just sleep and sleep. I literally napped in the middle of the day for no reason today. Maybe it's avoidance of reality, maybe it's fatigue because of just mentally suffering all the time, idk. Sleeping is the only thing I feel I can do consistently these days.",I do that too. Sleep to waste time. To dream a better enjoyable life. I had a dream I was playing video games with an old high school friend last night. Most cheerful dream Ive had in a long time.  Couldnt get back to sleep though....
How to tell if someone is depressed and best ways to help?. What do you guys think are some tell-tale signs that someone's depressed or maybe just feeling down? What are a few things that you guys wish a friend/loved one would do to make you feel better?,"Ways to help are different for everybody, but calling them up and asking them if they'd be into a pizza and GOT (or something like that) night would help out a lot."
"Depression is not a good thing. I want to change, i need to change",hope you all the best in your journey
Just told who I consider to be my best friend at the moment that I'm feeling a bit suicidal. her response: smh    I'm so tired.,Agree with the other poster that some people think you're just saying it and don't mean it. I told my mother I wanted to kill myself when I was 11 and she told me to stop being stupid.
I just dont want to live anymore. Shit fuck im very tired,You are loved and you can get through this.
I've been so tired!. Last night I slept almost 15 hours and still felt groggy upon waking up. I've been sleeping in til noon whenever I don't have classes. Why?,"Sleep is complicated, depression is complicated. Just sleeping more does not automatically make you more well rested.  May I ask if there is a reason for your problems?"
My boyfriends friends hate me. I dont know why but they are making lies about me and dont want me to be in their parties anymore. His female friends seems to be really jealous about me.,"Maybe they're just jealous that he's spending more time with you than them. Regardless, it's not nice for them to make to be making lies about you. Does your boyfriend know that they are?"
"Trigger word that cause emotional breakdown?. I sometimes breakdown when someone questions me about the family or people close to me, which I don't have. I'm reminded of how much I longed for someone to understand me and also the loneliness and depression I hide everyday behind a cheerful personality.",Hostage. Refer to the people who ghosted me as hostages or say they were justified. Accuse me of not trying or blame me for my circumstance.
The problem is I believe everything is dumb luck.. I don't believe in hard work.,And that the ones who don't do shit are lavished and showered with loving attention.
Basic life.. Anyone else ever feel like you have no motivation to do anything that would impact the world in a positive way?,"Same, and I go to an expensive university so I feel even more like a waste because I can't find my passion like those around me. But I've been told it doesnt actually matter despite the gaping hole inside me. Hope you are ok&lt;3"
Im not the same person anymore. Schizophrenia changed everything about me and i hate myself. Ill never be the same again. my personality has no depth.,"Yup. Had a good life for 50+ years, then a slow slide, then a rapid slide, then my mind seized up, burned out, broke....a lot of disfunction now, peronality kinda leaked out like anti-freeze. I still enjoy entertainment, but I lack a sense of goals, unable to visualize anything beyond a couple of days, just zero motivation other than craving a snack. Not curious to learn anything, either. I miss my personality...."
"Looking back, my life has been dull of nothing but failures.. Damn, I just wanted to get lost in anime and not think about anything in real life, and then this asshole has to come and say the most relatable thing ever.","We're all failures in the end. The absolute objective of human life is to not die. But we all die someday. You could argue having kids and passing your genes is the main goal, but that's too easy. Who gives a shit anyway..when youre dead you wont care about your kids or the genes youve passed because youre dead."
Haven't been able to cry for a decade.. I think I'm permenantly numb. Has anybody else experienced this?,"I don't cry under what most people would consider emotional situations. Weddings, funerals, yadda yadda. But once in a while when I'm laying in the dark and I'm alone with my thoughts, it happens. And I curse at myself for such weakness, then."
Relief. Has someone got a recipe for Relief from an attack? Mine come more often atm and a way to ease them would rly come in handy,Hey bud. You're right but... don't feed the trolls.
"When I tell my mom that I'm miserable, she tells me that I should join the White Helmets in Syria so I can see real mysery. And therefore stop complaining.  Goddamn",Your mom sounds pretty awesome. That was metal as fuck.
"I just want a hug.. That's all, humans like human contact and all that.",I would love to hug you irl ;_; *hugs*
"Struggling from a breakup. My bf broke up with me a month ago. still heartbroken. I hate myself for not trying harder to make him happy. Now sad and alone, and I miss him so much. I even refer to him as my ex; it hurts too much.","Wow. It must have meant so much to give yourself to a relationship where that loss hurts this bad. Holy crap, that's quite the level of commitment! Well, that is something to hang your hat on. You have that in you, right? You did it once before. Yea shit hurts right now but you have it in you!!.I cant imagine how happy you will be when you find the next one...maybe one that fits the possibility of a promising relationship? Well, I think you have a good base here. :)"
Just saw the girl I've liked for over a year with her boyfriend. Fucking hell I wish I wasn't socially retarded or messed up. I'm pretty sure there was a point in time where she did like me. I hate myself so much.,I know the feeling. It hurts to think of our missed opportunities and how we failed to express ourselves.. It hurts like hell to have to go through this over and over without changing.
"Do you guys ever imagine yourself killing a 'version' of yourself that's all the things you hate in yourself?. like not killing yourself in a suicidal way, but imagining pushing the depressed-self/the part of yourself you hate off a bridge or building or strangling them? Is this like...self loathing or something? is this normal in non-depressed/mentally ill people?","Sometimes. Though I hate to admit it, but a lot of the time it ends up being me imagining myself as the 'depressed me' with different hair and a more callous personality and the 'good me' is already gone. I don't know what that represents about my own mental state, but oh well"
Oh my god he has a Valentine’s. Fuck please help me this hurts so fucking bad,"It happens dude, all been there. I say going to get better any soon, but it will get better. Your best bet is to take a step back take a deep breath and just try to function without thinking or talking to that person. help the feelings die down, atleast in my experience. currently going through a heart break myself so I can feel your pain but she keeps constantly texting me when trying to stay distant and making me cave and chat with her"
Can't look in the mirror without wanting to cry. I look like the human version of a Nasty Patty.,Beauty is so subjective. There are people out there who will be blown away by you. But I can relate to how hard it is not to live up to your own taste. Take it from someone who has learnt she would rather be valued for her mind than her face/body. People attracted to you for your looks can also be a curse.
i can’t be on my own.. it lets me drown in my emotions.,I get that. You have so much time so you just start thinking and thinking is very dangerous for people like us. If u want here for u
Does anyone else not feel apart of this world?. I feel disconnected from everything at all times. It's like I am watching someone else control my body while I just sit in the passengers seat.,"Yes. All the time. I find myself just moving along, following whatever life throws at me. I constantly have this feeling of dread overwhelm me when I notice my brain and distancing myself from the I know what to think. This life sucks. I just never wanted to exist."
"Why do my friends not care about me?. always been a pretty introverted kid so that means less friends, but recently found out my few friends ever care about had the same friend group for the past 3 years and I always thought we were all pretty good friends but now I feel like they actually care about my well being. It was small things like making fun of me just like friends do but I feel like more than good fun. always small flaws about me as well like drinking soda or doing poorly on a test. I usually do anything to provoke them but I am short tempered so I can get mad at them. They also like ganging up on me so hard to fight their insults. If I could I would just ignore them and hang out with other friends but I have any other friends everyone at my school usually just ignore me because the quiet kid. Can someone please tell me why my friends care about me? This has been made me really depressed recently so any help is nice.",Trust your intuition. 99% of my friends treated me like garbage and when I got away from them and built my self-confidence up I did things I never thought I would manage.
Depression. I struggled with depression for quite some time now. I did so well at finding the light in life and doing things not even imagineable...but lately that light has been dulling out again and I am worried that I will hit that rock bottom again.,"Stay positive friend! Keep your momentum going!  I've had two mantras that I've carried with me since I first muddled through depression as a child. The first is Momentum. I start my day by making my bed, and it gives me a little feeling of accomplishment, and I make it to the next thing, and I try to carry this energy throughout the day, and into the next day. The second is Resolve, and it comes out on the days where I just completely dropped my momentum. These days are much harder, and I have to remember that its worth continuing on, that there's always a little beauty in every moment, even if it's sad beauty, and that I am able to help in the world.  Today was a Resolve day for me, but I'm really hoping to get back into a Momentum day tomorrow! Keep a hold of the reasons you found the light, and the way that light made you feel."
Getting a crush while depressed is terrible. You know nothing will happen and you can't get them out your head. At least it rivals suicidal thoughts in frequency though i guess.,"Yeah I have a crush on a girl who lives in my same city, she's just perfect, I'd like to talk to her often and to smile when she is near me but I'm just thinking if she would miss me if I die, I was also used to write her but then I stopped thinking that I was annoying her, now I hardly think she is just laughing about me with her friends but I can't get angry with her for that, she's too beautiful."
I want to die. That's all I have to say,"Most of us on this subreddit have been/are there. I know i have. I tend to dwell on the past far too often and besides it's obvious drawbacks it does have one advantage. Remembering the time i did want to die and how I thought there was no other way out. But I decided to live and I haven't actually wanted to die since. Sure things suck, most of the time for longer than we'd like but there are alot of things that make life on this planet right now worth living. I personally am not religious. I think once your dead it's lights out and I very much enjoy consciousness. I only felt what it was like living without it once or twice and those were not pleasant experiences. I'm still technically Depressed, I have been most of my life and likely will be until it's over or I find what it is i need to do with myself to get there. What helped me go from uber frustrated to content is to continue to evolve. I cut off everyone i knew and reevaluated what I want in life... Apparently it's living in a van and not staying anywhere long enough to feel stagnant. I'm not at all a people person and i have a family full of happy go lucky dimwits who talk nonsense and gossip repeating the same routine like that i what life is. That's not what i want. To be happy you need to forget about everyone and their bullshit, and be who you are where you are. Experience what life is, don't waste it and don't throw it away before you've lived it fully. I'm stuck right now, been hibernating as my little brothers personal housekeeper because my anxiety drives me to near agoraphobia. But once i get out of here I'll take all the lessons I've learned on /r/vandwellers and start my life as i know it should be and hopefully that brings me piece of mind for once. That's what works for me, but if your not an antisocial INTP then you might not want to live in a van lol. But I'm sure there is some way you see life should be... There's an entire world out there, look at the room around you and remember that's less than a microbe in the grand scheme of things. Do what what want do what drives you, not what you think is expected of you. It's your life, you are the one setting the standards and accepting them. Fuck everyone else."
"Moral of the story dont be different.... you be different , everyone will be put you down and you will be a scapegoat",Don't give up! You are valuable. You are strong. Take care of your physical and mental health. Practice self-love. Hope things get better for you.
"Are you ever doing kind of okay, and then suddenly your depression hits you in the face with a brick, and you're not okay at all for awhile?. Because that's about where I am right now.",when i'm not feeling depressed I'm anxiously waiting for it to hit me again. I'm unhappy no matter what
really horrible day.. had a nightmare where i was sick and dying. cant shake it off :( panicing,Hey do you like purple velvet cake??
I wish I could inherit some terminally ill childs disease. I would gladly trade my health with anyone that needs it,"Staple your organ donor paperwork and DNR paperwork to your shirt, sit at front door to emergency room, shoot self in brain."
"Feeling like a failure. I'm not doing too well right now. I'm feeling like I let everyone down, and I can't stop about everything I've done. About how I fell to rock bottom so quickly. About who and what I lost. I I don't know what to do anymore",We all make mistakes. We all let people down occasionally. No one expects us to be perfect. We do however have to learn from our mistakes. Hopefully you can find how to better yourself from whatever mistake you made.
I avoid looking at any mirrors because i can't stand what i see. Does anyone else have this problem?,"I think a lot of people have this problem, especially when they are depressed. I know that when I'm especially hating on myself, I don't like looking at the mirror. I think we can be way too harsh with ourselves. It's hard for mew to look at myself when I'm super caught up with how I'm supposed to be at my age and everything. You're not alone in this feeling. We need to be kinder and more forgiving of ourselves."
I don't let myself be happy. Because I know that I'm gonna go back to feeling like shit again. I know something bad will happen eventually and I'll hate myself even more. if I don't let myself be happy and something happens I won't be surprised because I'm a piece of shit anyway.,Yep. Couldnt have said it better myself.
"Does anyone else find themselves compulsively showering?. noticed when my episodes are at their worst, end up taking 4-5 showers a day. not abnormally stinky or anything. It just feels nice and feels like a I guess..? I mean I guess no harm In it, just wondering if anyone else is the same way",Exactly the same. Sometimes its like a way for washing away the thoughts and the hatred towards yourself.
"My anxiety feeds my depression, and my depression only feeds my anxiety.. Sometimes I get anxious about getting anxious, I just want to die. It is either I'm depressed or I'm anxious. I can't deal with this suffering anymore. It just lasts forever",I feel the same. I'm sorry.
If our lives are predetermined why can't I see the ending to know why I should continue living. I just don't know what I want to do anymore and wish I could see into my future to know whether or not there is going to be light at the end of this tunnel.,"Our lives aren't predetermined. You have find out what you love doing &amp; what makes you happy. It isn't easy, but it's always worth it."
"Did anyone get way far into drug use as cooing that now you have a drug dependency problem as well. That's how I feel cigs, weed, porn and pills. I think I'm dependent on all of them and I feel it frying my brain","For me, it's beer, pills and sex. It's normally short term for me, but I've found myself in a years long rut right now."
"nothing matters in the end.... everything that we do, its just lost with time.  I just feel like rolling into a ball and cry for the night...",Have you looked into getting help?
My job depresses me. My job in a local call centre depresses me. I want to be out of there so fucking much it is debilitating. I want to be a web designer. How do I get out!,"Learn the skills you need to to start getting small gigs. Build more skills. Take gradually bigger gigs. Once a steady, sustainable thing going, quit the day job. Loads of free or cheap resources around for learning the skills. Take some college courses if you want, but I say strictly necessary."
"My girlfriend left me. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. It feels as though anyone I truly love betrays me, it's not easy for me to open up to anyone, to truly have trust for them and any form of care is extremely difficult for me. And this just reinforces my belief that I can't trust anyone.  I gave her everything, I cared for her when she was down despite me living in hell for years, treated her, loved her and she leaves me for a complete scumbag who is notorius for fucking women over then moving onto the next one. So fuck you depression and fuck the pair of those pricks.","I'll give you the /relationships answer: Hit the lawyer, delete the gym. Or like, the other way around. I know, not married, but it still cheers me up to say that :)  Some people are shit. But mostly, people are clueless. People are at different places, different stages in their life. Find any average girl in her late twenties or older, and they'll likely be able to tell you some things they did to dudes they weren't proud of after the fact, but at the time, seemed like the most sane and logical thing, something they needed to do. Guys do the same, just in a different manner. On both sides, it hurts like hell, and is something everyone goes through.  Focus on yourself. Not the Tony Robbins rah-rah go you! I mean depression hits, end of relationships suck, they mess with your head and your body. Gym is good because it helps both your self confidence and makes both your body and your head feel better. Best of luck :)"
I’ve started to pray more recently. I pray that die in my sleep every night.,"Me too, and I don't even believe in a god. Just do it on the chance I'm wrong"
"I can't do it anymore. I can't even begin to describe how I've been feeling recently. I just want to stop existing. I know for a fact that the way I am going to die is suicide. I don't know when, but soon. Wow, I really need help.",I'm just waiting until I turn 21 so I can buy my own alcohol and spend the next year killing my liver. I think 22 will be my last year but sometimes I don't even think I can make it there.
Made it to another birthday folks.. Nothing special. No need for comments. Just kind of checking in. Don't know why birthdays are such milestones. No plans or parties. Been on a couple meds for almost a month now.  I'm just here.,"Same here, my birthday is today. Not doing anything special, same shit different day. Also been on meds for nearly a month. Have you noticed any differences from the meds? I haven't noticed any difference, aside from feeling like shit when I wake up lately."
"Anyone else just feel completely demorelized and defeated. After years of this depression thing, at some point all you can do is look in hindsight and think wow, this sure has made my life miserable",Every day my friend...every day
"I don't want to do anything. I'd say I wanted to die, but I don't even want that, there's just a complete and total lack of desire for anything at all.. I just fester and exist. Marginally.","Sorry. I feel the same way. There's absolutely nothing in this life I want. It is kind of driving me crazy though because I don't know what to literally, actually do."
"Your biggest fear. When u felt depressed ,what was your biggest fear?  Mine was dying without leaving any impact, without making a single meaningful connection with anyone.","My future, I don't know what I'm going to do and how shitty my life will be."
What happens after a suicide attempt?. What happens to you? Did you get admitted? How did your friends and family react? Just curious. Feel free to add where your from since its probably a lot different with the medical part from country to country..,"I'll hit you with the two most powerful stats I learned:  Less than 25% of the people who attempt to kill themselves and live, ever try again. Ever. Only 7% of people who have attempted end up dying by suicide. So, chances are what happens is a lot of regret for the pain the action can cause others, but also the realization of how many people do care and would help and support if called upon."
"My car is clean for the first time in years. Because starting to figure out not only about self care, care for everything, as much as you can. a good day. I hope have a good day as well.","I'm proud of you! Even though I don't know you I truly am. Care for everything that's worth caring, you'll find it's more than it seems."
Does anyone spend money recklessly when you're depressed?. Like buying stuff above your means?,"Made a throwaway a few weeks ago to post something similar to this. But yes, absolutely. The past two years my depression has gotten worse, and so has my credit card debt. I feel like ive dug myself a hole that I can't get out of because of it. Most of what I bought was food too, so I cant even return any of it haha."
My heart. My heart keeps beating. It beats fast and hard. I feel blood flowing though me. Its too fast. Its irregular. Why does this happen. Im just laying in bed. An insomniac. Is this anxiety. Am i nervous. What is happening. Help me.,"Mate, get yourself down to hospital and have an ECG. Make enquiries about this. I had the same thing and wrote it off as anxiety, and it got worse. In my case it wasn't just anxiety. Take the condition of your heart seriously, if you're worried get it checked."
This new guy at my job. Has been here 2 weeks and all the girls are fighting over him. It must be nice being genetically superior. Makes life hella lot easier,I feel that. Coming from a 5' 5 male
Theres A demon in me thats trying to kill me.. I cant fukin handle tgis mich longer,Does anyone know about that demon?
Im just not okay anymore. And the rest is silence,just tired. like a zone-out feeling but 24/7. foggy.
"School reopens,vacations over tomorrow. I don't want to go to school.. I don't even have a friend in my class, I don't want to go to school.","I hated school partly for this reason. Everyone always came back chatty and excited about what they'd done over the holidays. I had no one to tell what I'd been up to for the last few months. It was mostly just doing mundane stuff with my parents, but I still wanted to join in the conversation."
"Heavy weight on my mind. I don't know if anyone can relate to this, but I always feel like there's a massive weight being put on my mind. And I don't mean that as a figure of speech either. It physically feels like my mind is being crushed with massive weight.",Yup that's me as well. The weight you described plus this suffocating feeling/atmosphere. I hope it will disappear once I find the right medication.
Soon I’ll be dead. You think so but happen in a very short period of time,What makes you feel like this?
No matter what I do I can't win his heart. And he keeps on rejecting me,Give up then. Why keep on smacking your head against a brick wall. That is a lesson I have learned the hard way.
"Every body know i want to kill myself but nobody care. A few month ago, i told to my mum the fact that i whas thinking of killing myself, and she didn't even react to it, so now i'm just lost on my way to sucide (Sry for my bad english)","Maybe she just didn't know how to react to it... or just in shock. i think you should see a therapist because it seems that you're a danger to yourself or you could talk to a close friend about your suicidal thoughts. There's more to life than people's validation about you, trust me. It really gets better overtime. Bad thoughts will come and it will pass, you need to find support of others to overcome it."
"Dear r/depression, how do you deal with the constant existential dead?. It's been haunting me for weeks now.","Acceptance. I've been dealing with it for quite a while now. It's really easier said than done, but after realizing you cannot change objective reality, it gets easier. I find comfort in the fact we truly know nothing. Meaning, perhaps there is more to our observable reality than we can sense. I doubt this however. At least we have been dead before, and it's not something entirely too new."
"Help. I have been having terrible thoughts for years now, and I am finally getting the courage to want to see someone. Can someone recommend what type of doctor to go to?",There are many sources of therapy for various situations. It all depends on what these thoughts are and how often you get them.
"There's an everyday, physical heaviness in my heart now.. I can't get it to go away. I used to be better than this.","i know this feeling it sucks so hard, you should try meditating like breath 5 seconds in and 5 seconds out for a long time and you will feel a bit better"
The loneliness is hitting early this weekend. Gonna be a rough one,"i feel the same but also the opposite. sometimes i hate being alone, but many times i wish i was alone when i'm with people i don't like. I'm not sure which is worse. Do you have any good friends?"
Tired of faking myself. I'm really tired now faking almost everything. Answering those how're you is feeling like a chore. I'm always conscious to smile during conversation and it's taking a toll. Don't look tired. Look happy. Stay positive. I'm just.. tired of everything.,"I can totally relate. It feels like you are living on Facebook and you are expected to only show the good things to appease everyone. Personally I have stopped doing that now and the people who are actually really my friends and who truly care, have stuck around, the rest - I actually don't care about now. I have the right to be sad, I have the right to not be okay and to have a down time."
Boring. I feel like I've got to the point where this is just boring now. I'm just the same. I'm boring. I have nothing to offer people. I'm trying to look with a positive outlook but I just don't know how to not feel like *this*. Thanks for reading. I'm sorry.,"What do you enjoy doing in your free time. Sitting around being depressed doesn't make for good story-telling. At least it didnt for me.  Also, please don't apologize. We absolutely want to hear how you're feeling on this sub and it's beneficial to see and hear other people's perspectives going through this hell."
I feel like there's no particular reason to my depression. But then life decided to add a few.,"There will very likely be a reason to your depression as depression doesn't really start from nothing, sweetheart"
Help!. Well... I been thinking too much about **Suicide.**,Why are you thinking about it? What's so wrong in your life that you feel the need to take such drastic measure?
"What is it that's giving you Depression?. Fake friends, Family problems, Fake friends, fake friends are the some of the reasons that are giving me this.","cut out fake friends, don't worry about family problems and focus on urself."
"Goodbye. Edit: still alive for now, because of you guys ^^","I wonder if there is actually a part of you that hopes that ppl do care, do worry about you, but your scared of hurting others, cos thats how i feel"
I've just spent the entire day in bed. It feels wrong to think I've had a bad day.,"Hey, is there something that's overwhelming you, or something that you are avoiding? What is going on? Why are you in bed? Sometimes when you share it can help to lighten the burden."
"Should I end it now that it's all going well?. Things are picking up, slowly but surely. Should I end my life on a high note?",Well you wouldn't really be able to enjoy it while dead.
"I can't wait to hopefully look back at my life now and realize it was all worth it, and that the pain will go away.. I just want to be happy. thats all","It may not seem like it now, but whatever you're feeling is just a step forward. Without now, next can't happen. The Moment you finally become happy is the same moment you realize all the pain was worth it. Everything you're experiencing is a unique experience that you and only you will ever experience. Why not make your unique experience a happy one? If you need help being happy or finding it, go explore and see what you like. Whether it be asking people online, or going and experiencing something for yourself when you look back, you'll be happy you did it, and happiness is all that matters."
I tried to kill myself. It did not work.. Really wish it worked oh well.,So you sick af now or your liver is fucked or something?
"Life has it's ups and downs, I get that.. But where the fuck are all my ups right now?",Every time I dare think I am moving up in any way I get beat down. In any field of life that I try to improve. Its just incredible.
My fellow sufferers who work in retail.... How we hangin' this holiday season? Me? Not so good. Like suicide not so good. Like nervous breakdown/ bodyslam someone not so good....,I hear you brother/sister. I recently stepped down from management position so I can work by myself. It's a bit better.
I love Sertraline. It's same important as parents for me,&gt;I love Sertraline  I got side effects from it so had to look elsewhere. I'm glad it's working for you though.
will be swallowing all of my psych meds tonight!!!. good riddance to me. fuck living!!!!,Thats not a good idea friend
I hate my life so fucking much right now.. I hate myself so much. Why is life so difficult. Constant self loathing. just sitting by the computer all day. Doing nothing. I'm just a fat ugly virgin loser. I hate this life. I hate myself. I didn't ask to be born in the first place... Why am i expected to accept life as it is then? Ugh...,"I looked at your post history(sorry, I'm nosy) and what caught my eye was that you were upset that you feel girls don't find you attractive. The key there was you said you don't even bother talking to them. A fear of rejection is what keeps most people single, I think. Even just smiling at a girl when she walks by might make you feel better. If she gives you that, What do you want, weirdo? look, that's her insecurity, and those aren't the kind of people you want in your life anyways. Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. My problem is the opposite, I'm skinny as a rail and short. Upon putting myself out there, I found that some people actually think I'm attractive. You're your own worst critic, so I sincerely doubt your just un-lovably ugly. And about your weight, treat it like an RPG, make a game of losing weight. You'll start to feel better about yourself the more you lose. It can be kind of fun to work on yourself, especially when you start to see results. I was talking to my parents the other day, and calorie counting apparently worked wonders on them. Do some research and see what's best for you, I'm no doctor. Hope this helps."
how can you feel like always wanting to cry but can never actually cry. seriously how? i can never not feel like this lately,"Every day. Depression dulls your physical emotions. On the inside I may be screaming and balling my eyes out, but I physically let it out when I try. The only times I cry are when I have an extremely deep thought that hits me hard and ball out of nowhere for literally 5 seconds before I pull myself together. Another 5 seconds later like nothing even happened..."
Kill me.. Nothing helps. No one says anything positive. I'm just a waste of space. I know all my friends could get by without me just fine. No one cares about me. I wish I were dead..,"Sometimes the suffering gets too much, you know? I'm in a similar situation to you."
"For a billionth time. Can I die? Just, just die already. Just fucking die.",No. Who are you? Why do you need to die?
"What advice would you give to a 16 year old who is lonely, struggles with depression and feels like they are wasting their youth sat at home all day?. Title pretty much covers it.","Don't fuck up your education.  I ended up getting kicked out of the Swedish equivalent of high school at 17 because I stopped attending classes as I progressivly got worse. I ended up getting a lot better the last two years but I'm now approaching my mid 20's with fuck all to show for, which has made me start feeling pretty bad again as I'm trying to play catchup.  If i just finished that shit I could at least be at university now... fuck me."
"Do you eat when you're depressed?. I heard people overeat when they're depressed, I'm the exact oppisite I had a really bad depression for like a week and i ate like a half a sandwich a day for like a whole week","I don't eat, I just drink soda."
Anyone else not have opinions anymore. I just have nothing to say,"Yep. At this point, I find that having opinions, especially controversial ones, are too tiring. What's even the point of getting worked up and angry?"
Some one kill me please. Fuck this life fuck existence fuck everything fuck fuck,I want to sign up to that as well.
:/. really sick of this life I want to kill myself,please don't. I'm telling you. Just don't. Think about your loved one. Seek help from professionals. Try to rationalize everything.

I want to give up.,Hey sorry things are blank for you just hold in there and try to find something unique about yourself or make something and give it a purpose in your life. motivation have to come from inside yourself alone it can be other places or times

Please help me. keep starting me off badly. Please just help.,I don't really understand what you mean. What exactly do you need help with?
I’ve written.... I wouldn’t say poems I wouldn’t say much of anything but these are things that I’ve written while drunk and high on drugs but never have Read. But would like to get feedback onto it maybe figuring out how I feel deep inside.. Innocence in such an pure world,"Oh oh, I know! Youthful enthusiasm for life is great and when your world is like that, it's great! And you live life without reservation. Theeen you get older and wiser and sadder because life is hard and oddly enough that freedom you dreamed of having as a kid was actually what you had, weirdly enough, as a kid."
Please don't leave me. I don't want to be alone.,"I love how nice people are to each other in this sub. It's really amazing, I wish I would see this type of support in real life more often."
"Do you ever think depression is actually just being more in tune with how shit life really is?. Like you can dress it up how you want, but it is it?",I guess people just are born or moulded into different mindsets and a lot of people unfortunately got a shitty one where they struggle to be happy
"I had a girl who loved me to the moon. And I threw it away. If you want the details let me know in the comments. I'm too tired to write it all rn.  Long story short: girl, lives 9000 km away. We met online. We got close. She ended up loving me, and i rished into a long distance online relationship. I knew that I'd be leaving for university soon, and I didn't want that move to hurt her. So I broke up with her. I thought I was helping her, you know. I didn't want her wrecked later, and I honest to god just wanted her to be happy. I thought if she found someone near her, she'd be happier. On the other hand: I basically lost 6 months of happiness. I had her. And now she's gone. She told me she moved on. And only now have I realized... I haven't. I still like her. I don't even know what kind of comments I want or get. Yes it's my fault. Completely mine. Do I regret it? No. She needs to be happy. But still.",You know you did the right thing. Be proud of that.
i fucking manned up and told my SO what my priorities were. i feel anxious like hell but it feels pretty good.,"Good for you! I know for me, speaking up for myself can be hard. But it's a step in the journey!"
Shame. Anyone just feel deeply ashamed to be you? I'm really ashamed of what I am I hate everything about myself and just feel like a freakshow for everyone and everything to laugh at.,"Yep. Shame, guilt and regret are my primary emotions."
Does anybody go sleep and wish all their problems just vanish before they wake up?. It's the only thing left that gives me hope.,Yep and they never do
I don't Know If This Is Normal Or Not. I always feel like i'm a loser and not worth people's time is that considered a form of depression ?,"not really a form of depression, but it can definitely be a symptom of it. Feeling that you are worthless, a burden, a failure, are all very common to those suffering from depression. What separates it from simply having low self esteem, which many people do, are whether or not you have the other symptoms associated with depression. Things like lack of energy and interest, hopelessness about the future, difficulty sleeping/eating/focusing, suicidal thoughts; experiencing these things on a consistent basis for weeks/months/years is definitely indicative of some sort of depression. Take some time and think about how you feel and been causing it, Do some research into your thoughts and what others say about it. If you decide you need or want help, be afraid to reach out to others and communicate your troubles. I wish you the best of luck, you got this."
I don't think most people would care if I killed myself. Maybe they'd be sad for a day but they'd probably move on...,Honesty this is how I feel... I'm currently making a plan too... don't plan on being here for too much longer in all honesty
"Maybe suicide is the answer. People say it gets better. Well, for the past four years its been getting worse. What's the point of living if there's nothing worth living for? I'm thinking of finally going through with this.",I promise it's not the answer. You're at a low point right now. Things will get better you really just have to wait. Call +18002738255 if you feel really bad. Do you see a therapist?
Zoloft. I've been on 50mg daily zoloft since Thursday. Along with .25 MG xanax for anxiety and depression. What to expect?,My suicidal thoughts are getting worse on Zoloft. Im currently on 75mg. My doctor warned me it was a possibility. If that starts happening make sure you call your doctor asap. I take Lamictal and Buspar with the Zoloft. My combination of medication along with my bipolar disorder could be causing my side effects I'm not sure.
I'm going to be alone my entire life.. Even I don't to be with myself..,"I think everyone has good characteristics to them. Everyone's good at something. Your mind won't buy it, I know, but there's a ton of stuff you've been doing longer successfully than anyone else has: your life, and everything in it. I don't know about you but I know you're good at something, not that you have a particular gifted talent but you do have a strong suit of some kind that you can hone in some way to your advantage. I believe everyone can find their if they try."
It's a pattern!. How do I break it?,"I suppose it depends on how deep the pattern is, something that help some people is to use a calendar and write down things to do during which hours everyday in advance and try to force yourself to not break the schedule. Doesn't work for me but i know that it works for some people.  The most important part i'd say is to find a goal to strive towards."
I have to go to work in 45 minutes. I tried calling off by lying about being sick but I find anyone to cover for me.  I know how manage honestly.,Being a wagecuck is hard I feel you
"Hopefully I'll die in my sleep tonight. Won't happen, but a man can dream...",What's making you want to? I feel like this sometimes.
I started getting better after a long period of depression but now it's back. like nothing has changed fuck,"well maybe there's something that made u feel better for a while, so u felt like you're getting better. Find that shit, don't let your progress go for nothing. I'm rooting for u buddy"
"Im starving.. I fell too anxious and depressed to eat :(. Its painful, my mother left money to buy pizza for us, but dressing up, taking a shower then driving 15 minutes to get pizza seems impossible..  Typo, feel instead fell.",Maybe try and cook some noodlesor rice at home for now. Oatmeal? Potatos? Beans? There should be something edible in your house that doesn't require you to go outside.
I keep thinking I've hit rock bottom and then it gets even worse. so much for all that It gets better bullshit.,"I know what you mean. Seems like it'll never get better, it just gets worse even though it doesn't seem like it could get any worse. Sucks."
"I feel like a computer.. I feel like a computer. I feel like I've lost the ability to feel emotion, even boredom. I'm sitting here waiting for an idea for something to do to roll by.",Only if it detects any sort of input. Computers are actually pretty stupid by themselves.
"Anyone else my age and depressed? I'm 16.. I have a normal life with a loving family. Yet I just don't want to exist anymore. School sucks and I feel it's futile. I want a relationship but am too scared and hate myself too much. I feel like I am ready to die, or just not exist.","yea I'm literally in the same boat. sometimes I find something I love and become so happy. but once I finish and remember real life, I just fall back into the rut."
How do you find someone who cares?. I've been wondering that for my entire lifetime...,What do you want someone to care about?
my dad hits me. and he took away my xbox,Could you call child protective services?
Should I make everyone hate me before I die?. Maybe I don't even need to,"No, I basically did this and dug myself into a much deeper hole to climb out of."
"Friendless, jobless, skillless, useless... Anyone in the same boat?","You are not useless. I used to think the same, but I have always been good at writing and research. I decided to start freelancing my services, and I do quite well for myself. It's no replacement to a full time job just yet, but I really enjoy the freedom and receiving positive client feedback. Everyone has something to offer, just have to make a start.."
Not sure if this is right place but I need some answers.. Does anyone know how to find therapists / councilors for very low income &amp; no insurance?,"That depends on where you are in the world. Where I'm at in the USA, BHR (Behavioral Health Resources) would be the place to inquire. I'm pretty sure they're nation wide but lack the resources to really help many people though. Mental health care system is a joke, especially in the low/no income sector. Worth pursuing if you're in need. Just might take a little time and patience."
Help with depression. It's been 9 months and I have been battling depression and I'm giving up on the fight. I don't know how to make myself feel better. I hope one of you knows the answer,check out the rhodiola book by gerbarg and brown and fish oil book by andrew stoll md
Five people in my school district have killed themselves in 2016.. It's really weighing on me.,Suicide is contagious. Don't let yourself become another victim.
"I have absolutely nothing original to contribute to Reddit or real life. I'm good at stringing meaningless, unoriginal words together sometimes on Reddit  Not really talent show material",I would like to partake in the reddit talent show  Wait  No I wouldn't.
"Is it supposed to be like this?. had depression since I was probably around 14. 38 now and I recall a time when I depressed. Off meds my bouts of deep depression were much sharper it seems. On meds it seems like everything is dulled. Perhaps my age (and the fact that just sick of everyday life in general) that seems to have dulled life experience, maybe the seemingly constant barrage of tragedies and heavy personal baggage, but it seems like my doctors are just barely keeping me functional. It feels like psychological life-support. My question is, is this what meds are supposed to be? Just little bumpers to keep you from falling off the deep end? Do people take meds and actually experience...happiness in their life? Now asked this question to people (whom I know also take meds) straight to their face and I get a distinct feeling like being lied to as they tell me that they know what I mean, or that happy because they have a great family or whatever. But what are these meds really supposed to DO?",I feel the same way you do and would also like an answer to this question part of me want to stop taking them and fall off the deep end again im tired of putting on an act for my family because if I show them how I feel the tell me I need more meds
every day is the same. and its so boring and lonely,are we the same person?
"I've always been told that I'm a horrible liar, yet somehow I am able to fool everyone into thinking I'm okay.. I just wish somebody would notice that I'm really not.","Same here man. I hope your life gets better and that your day is fantastic, you really deserve it. I know that it's a struggle because I go through the same thing every day - do you ever laugh but feel like it's just not reaching your eyes anymore? That's me every day. I can't say that it 100% for certain gets better, but it COULD get better and that's what really motivates me every day."
"Every day I waste a 1.99 on OkCupid boost, just to get no views.. And it really hurts me.",Don't be hurt. All dating sites are money scams in disguise. The success rate of finding an actual person on there is very low. Majority of OkCupid profiles are bots and fake accounts with stolen pictures.
.... Is it ok for feel sorry for my self,"Life is not what happens to you - it's how you react to it.  If you feel sorry for yourself, and most depressed people do, it's because they decide that there is a payoff in doing it. It's showing sympathy for a person, and you're the person, because you aren't getting it from anyone else.  It all comes down to what comes after that. You can give up and never try again, or you can take that feeling and extend it into the future:  - Imagine feeling this way, and doing nothing about it, for a year. 5 years. 10 years. What has your life become?  - Now imagine what your life would be like if you forced yourself to get of bed, brush your teeth, went to the store or coffee shop, talked to someone, helped someone, every day. Now imagine doing that for a year. 5 years. 10 years. NOW what is your life like?"
Asking questions. I've had a really hard day. Blow after blow (and a parking citation on top of those blows.)  Just a couple moments ago I decided to ask my friends what they admire about me.  It helps. I'm weeping with knowledge that I'm not as terrible as I think.,That's good. If only everybody around me wouldn't lie every chance they could.
I love being depressed.. so good. Not having a reason to go on and going to sleep every night wanting to die is all dreamed of. I really purposefully put this on myself. I love these feelings of emptiness :),I envy you. I can only sleep like 4 hours a day
"I seem to always be the first to try and help someone else with their problems, yet when I need help nobody seems to be around to be an open ear for me, I wish I had someone in real life who cared enough to listen to me and just let me spill everything out. Anyone else feel this way?","I'm not entirely certain what reaction you're getting, but I hope you'll give those around you a little slack if they can't be as openly receptive and caring as you need at first. I'm sort of the designated problem solver in my circle, so quite a few of my friends come to me for advice and sympathy. It's never, never a burden. Instead, it's an honor. They trust me with their secrets, their problems, and value my opinion enough to ask for it. Reverse the situation. Aren't you glad when someone comes to you? The thing is, not everyone is built for that. Especially, I have found, it can sort of weird people out when the Rock, the Stable One, the One Person In This Messed Up World Who Has Their Stuff Together needs help. I mean, here's the person they go to and they rely on when they need support... and that person needs support. Suddenly you're not Superman anymore and it can be a bit disconcerting. Perhaps try introducing A problem at a time, slowly, and seeing if they can get used to you also being a normal human with issues. Good luck!!"
it just keeps getting worse. please tell me what to do.. I was let go from my job. My boyfriend left me. I can't stop crying. Everything is just....  I want desperately to die. I can't keep up with this. I'm not strong enough. Please just tell me what I can do to feel better.,"I am in the exact same place. I've lost two jobs and two boyfriends in the last year (2 jobs in the last 6 months). My ex lives two blocks away and I see him every time I leave the house. I never see my friends. I live alone and money is running out. I can't imagine finding a new job (my background makes it impossible) or finding new love (I'm too old). But you are not alone. Know that I am here and you can PM me and we can be there for each other, for whatever it's worth."
what is the easiest way to kill myself. I have no reason to live so please help me,"Sometimes you really need to be reminded of that other side and that you will in fact return to it. Don't make any big decisions when in the heat of the moment. Focus on other things (TV shows, artistic endeavours, school, etc) and return once you've cooled off. Good on you for reaching out for help, my friend. Despite these people not knowing you, we're all in this together. Keep your head up"
What do you want to stop?. I need everything to stop. People  Life.,Over thinking and running away from myself.Or everything because I don't know what would be better for me.
Should you kill yourself if you have no social life?. Should you kill yourself if you have no social life?,"No.  Not having a social life isn't a terminal diagnosis. Why kill yourself due to lack of social life if you could eventually obtain one?  Life is not pass/fail. It's not about getting a certain grade for social life, or any other aspect of life for that matter. You are not a failure.  Not having friends worsens depression, depression inhibits the ability to make friends. It's a cycle that needs to be broken, and I recommend getting medical help to tackle depression. Eventually you will get to a point where it is easier to make/maintain relationships, even if it that progress seems small at first. Keep up the fight."
"I've opened up to 2 people in my life and I never saw either of them again. Makes me not want to ever open up to anybody, these people were my best friends at the time and now I won't open up ever again because that person will leave me too and I can't afford to lose any more people in my life.","in the exact same boat, my ex just left me because of my depression, and I had told her how I had attempted before but had those thoughts since which was like 4 years ago but she freaked out and constantly kept thinking I was going to do something and now I never wanna tell people about any of my depression problems again."
You never do anything right!!'. Did that ever come across your head?,Yeah. How I wish I had a good job to support my parents. How I wish I had a place on my own to focus on relationships. How I wish I was my love-interest's focus. So yeah most things don't come out as planed here either.
Most of my life has been me chasing highs and lows just to feel something. Anything to stop feeling numb,"if you need someone to talk to, you can add my snap emma.xlea  i know music wont help this feeling, but i recommend high highs to low lows by lolo zouai. it helps me feel a little bit more refreshed."
I can't sleep. I wish I could hear someone singing a lullaby to me,"Neither, got drunk to try sleep but instead im going to be sleep deprived and hungover for christmas :D"
"you can ignore this. Sorry, I was scrolling through the contacts of my phone to find someone who I could tell without becoming a burden, and I find anyone. The point is I just wanted to say nothing here for me. I know I should value my life, cherish the friends and things I have, and look to the future with hope and anticipation, but I Because at the end of the day, still be me, rotten to my core. And been this way for a long time. had people try to convince me not. But just for once I want to hear someone tell me to do it.",Tell us more. Nothing said suggests so bad.
"Too short to join the army, too small for clothes, too awkward for jobs, too ugly for a girlfriend.. Too bad so sad, that's what I tell myself.",How tall are you dude?
"All they want me to do is write 3 things i enjoy doing for my job cv. I can't even think of one.. what do I enjoy doing? sleeping, feeling numb inside and sleeping.

You're so great at those three things!!! I envy you!!!!
Guys it really hurts. I just want it to stop,"Can you open-up a bit to explain? What's the matter? Go on, if it's alright with you."
"I constantly feel morally and intellectually superior to everyone around me, but with no evidence to back up these feelings.. Like, I'll look around me as I sit in lectures or walk around the university campus and think to myself these people are just so stupid, they understand nothing, they're so shallow and empty-headed, and I feel 100% confident in being right, but then I'll try to logically think about why I'm superior (and I'm also 100% certain that I *am* superior), and I come up with nothing. In any quantifiable measure of superiority, I always fail. And yet, I can't shake this feeling that everyone else is inferior to me. I think maybe it's just a gut reaction because of how unhappy and depressed I am, but I don't know. I know that I probably sound like a complete asshole to anyone reading this, but it's how I honestly feel.","Maybe it's a defense mechanism you created when you were a child? Maybe if you really searched, it's because on the inside you truly feel inferior?"
It won. I guess drugs and alcohol it is,"You know drugs and alcohol is just going to strengthen your emotions. You're just going to feel worse, but I'm sure you already know this.."
So much in life depends on having the right connections. Which includes making new connections..,What kind of connections do you want / need?
I want to kill myself. I really do... idk how... I don't want it to hurt but anything has to be better than living a hopeless life owned by someone else,"Please dont, you arent alone. There will always be someone who will miss you and wont be able to forgive themselves for not preventing it"
"Is there anyone here who has been constantly going to work for at least 5 years?. If yes, then how the hell do you do it? I hate going to work. I'm quitting jobs soo often.",Not really sure what you're asking. Had the same job for five years? Never taken a sick day? Just been consistently employed for 5 years? Or old enough to even have a five year work history?
"I gave up. I keep making the same mistakes, so I decided to just kill myself by starving myself to death.",starving yourself is slow painful and almost impossible op  whats happened anyway
"I hate it when depression becomes the new default. Like you have some good moments here and there, some times it lasts for hours or days, but then back with this really painful chronic depression. just tired, how did I end up this way...","This is also me, seemingly every goddamn fucking day, too. We may never know how we ended up this way, but hopefully we can figure out how to come out the other end of it. I wish nothing but strength to you to keep on carrying on. This sub right here shows you're not alone in this struggle."
Does anyone else fear for the loss of a loved one?. I keep having recurring dreams lately about losing everyone close to me. It is giving me terrible anxiety. How do you deal with that?,Who doesn't?  [Except people with abusive families]
Drunk and depressed. Does anyone else just feel the need to get drunk and high in their rooms alone?,"I just want to feel happy again. been treated like dirt by my father lately, he calls me an attention seeking snowflake. He believe in me, I begged him for mercy, but he only told me to shut up and let me cry for 2 hours straight all alone."
All I want is to live in a utopia. Every day I want to take a pretty girl on a date. Just repeatedly do that every day.,"I don't have any answers for the girl bit, but getting active in political and activist organizations could help work toward the desired utopia. Maybe you can meet some people with similar interests?"
Why am I not good enough to be loved by anyone?. Why? tried so hard and nothing ever works,"I'm really sorry for this. I'm going through something similar and I have pretty much given up all hope that I am the same as my peers.  I am definitely not. I feel as if everyday is a struggle for self acceptance even by myself. Everyday is a day where I am buffeted by my own worthlessness. I try my best, I do. I try my very best to get through. Every day is a drag, but at least its a drag and not a standstill.  After a while I forget people exist, really. It's just me and my depression. I don't need any more love from my peers after some time."
Numb.. Just numb. Not sad. Not happy. Just numb.,Yeah also feel numb often. Wanna talk about it?
‘The sadness will last forever’. I feel so lonely and empty and nothing is working,The sadness will not last forever. Tell us more about your predicament and I'll offer some advice and help!
My therapist discharged me. Lol. Not even my therapist wants me.,"I've struggled with abandonment issues most of my life, my fiancee left me last year, my friends and family act like I don't exist and even though I brought that up in the one counselling session I've ever had, I still got turned down for counselling. I tried going private and still got the same result. What does it say when someone with abandonment issues gets turned away by a therapist? You can't tell someone that their therapist cares about them because you care about the kids you look after."
"What to do when you dont have money for a psychologist?. I dont work... I am starting college, and I really wanted to consult with someone, but i dont have money, and a psychologist isnt that cheap, so the question really and is not just for me what does a person do when it doesnt have money for a psychologist?","Do you not have insurance through your parents' plan? What type of school are you going to? If it's a big enough school, it will for sure have resources available for students struggling with mental health issues. Definitely look to take advantage of what they might have to offer."
"Does it ever get better?. It's like two steps forward, ten steps back. It's exhausting.","So far it hasn't gotten better for me, I've just come to accept it. Things that when I was younger would've made me cry or get really mad now just miff me. For example today I found out that I got ripped off over $130 because of an irrevocable clerical error - that's about 1/3rd of what I make in a week, and I should be furious because this kind of thing happens far too often. But what good will that do me?"
"Have any of you looked in a mirror,. and hated what you saw?","Literally everyone has. This isn't some unique depression thing that isolates you like a lot of things about depression. Everyone has something about them they don't like, most people don't like what they see in the mirror, and still a lot fucking despise what they see."
Finally working. After waiting for sometime for a call back I'm finally going to be working after a longer then I wanted vacation. never thought a simple thing could be so uplifting.,Congratulations! Paycheck incoming. Netflix account incoming. Porn subscri- No?
"Feel like trash, skipped classes today because I just couldn't get myself out of bed. I'm tired and depression is kicking my ass. I really really wish I could get professional help","i skipped one class today because i don't really get much out of the class, but i forgot that there was 5% of the grade for in-class activities, so i'll probably not skip any more classes"
"I hate the direction my life is going right now, but I love it to be alive. Just wanted to say it...","I'm kind of the same way. My life sucks, I see no light in the proverbial tunnel but I rather be alive to see how the world turns out than leave my life for nothingness. Disclaimer, I believe that there's no life after death. If you've ever been unconscious you know what I'm talking about, one moment you're awake, the next you wake up somewhere else with no sense of time gaining passed. That but forever is death to me, there's simply nothing, it just ends completely. I rather suffer than cease to exist."
"I have never met any one thats depressed.. I wonder if we are all really good at hiding it, or just bad at noticing other people who are depressed.  also what are you guys doing this summer? stay inside and hide as per usual?",I met my mother and some trans people.
"Has anyone here gotten better and stayed better?. As far as I've been able to tell, no matter if you get better or not, depression will always just come back. Temporary problem, my ass.","One of my friends got better. Like, not just temporarily felt better, but like, actually got completely *better*. Honestly I was kind of shocked. I mean, I guess we all dream of someday getting better, but I'd never really heard of that actually happening before.  She lost a ton of weight, got into a happy relationship, and has half a dozen dogs. And she's *normal* now. Like, not depressed or anxious anymore. She's happy.  I'm really happy for her, not just because she's my friend and I'm glad she's not suffering anymore (although that's part of it), but also because it means that getting better really is possible and it's not just some made up dream. But at the same time I feel really awful and sad when I talk to her, because when I hear about how wonderfully her life is going now and how great she's doing, I feel like a worthless failure mentioning my own life. We used to bond over talking about how awful mental illness can be, and I felt like she was a light in the darkness, someone who was weathering the storm with me and who truly understood my pain. Now I feel ashamed because she's moved on and I haven't. I feel like bringing up how I feel now would only make her feel guilty and awkward.  It feels like as my friends start to get better and move on with their lives while I remain stuck here making no progress, there's no longer any place for me."
Tired. enough todaying for today. Im done.,Okay... Do you want to talk about it?
im in a contsant cycle of going from''i want to improve myself'' to ''fuck life i just want to sit home be miserable and do nothing''. i hope im not the only one feeling this way,"You arent. I can only speak for myself here but I sometimes get stable enough to motivate myself to lessen my consume of electronics and be productive instead and read, tidy up and continue learning the language ive been working on. However those ups usually dont last long cause its easy to trigger me into collapsing again. The only way out is gettin a potent therapist or the right pills I guess"
The next 2 days are going to be hell.... ...and then it will probably take me a fucking week to recover. It's horrible indeed when an unexpected episode hits but right now I feel like forseeing it is worse. Ugh.,I'm with you. Let's take it one day at a time. What can we do today that will help?
"Alone. I feel like I fit in any group,like in school or work nor my family, alone and I belong to any. just me in my own world and everyone is turning around.",I feel the same. I wish I could see all the people in public who feel this way because I bet a lot of the people like you or me who feel like this could be friends because we understand something about eachother that no one who felt that way understands.
zero motivation. go to classes the last two times i see the point anymore in fact i see the point in anything anymore i just wanna be here,"I know exactly how you feel. I can't get myself to study or do any work. Sometimes it really makes me worry about my future, and other times I think Am I even planning on staying here that long?"
"Help me find a will.... My penis is small, not even prostitues will fuck me for money. 34 and a virgin and my penis is really small and everyone calls me a nerd. probably going to kill myself i have much going for me. I wish I had a big dick...",Is this supposed to be a joke? I apologize if it isn't.. just sort of seems that way to me
I have a job interview. I'm about to have an interview. I'm horribly nervous and pessimistic but it is an accomplishment after months of being unable to go outside and feeling like shit. I really hope things go okay.,getting an interview is hardest part and you achieved that! good luck!
"Just want one fucking night of decent sleep. My brain keeps torturing itself while asleep... this is like the 4th night in a row woken up in the middle of the night sweating and on the verge of a panic attack. The one tonight was about insecurity and not having the ability to stand up for what I was passionate about. Not that I want to but that I strong enough too. Idk why this always happens. My concious mind I can usually handle okay, but my sub-concious mind absolutely wrecks me. Anyone else deal with this or have any tips?","Don't know if it helps in the long run but apps with binaural beats might help. They worked the first time for me, but my body got used to it later on."
"why do I feel this. Why do us as humans feel the need to love, and be loved in return. And why if we dont recieve this level of effection do we turn to depression. Is our depression a weird form of coping cause by a lack of affection?",Can't really explain why but it is just a basic need
I showered today for the first time this week. I still feel like shit,"I think people are meant to regularly bathe. Like we have probably been bathing while still hairy and grunting. I wasn't raised the best; one thing is that I was never taught to bathe regularly. It was normal to bathe once every 2-4 weeks growing up. Basically, I never had it ingrained into me, which led to being super hygienic to the point of irritation and skin problems during puberty, and complete abandonment of hygiene during my intense depressive periods.  So during these periods I would go as long as I could possibly can without showering until it was literally affecting everything I did, usually 4-6 weeks. My dirtiness would get into my eyes, and they would burn like hell. I got more skin problems from the build up of dead skin: in grown hairs, dry scaly skin, acne, etc. My hair had issues too: unhealthy and wiry possibly from an unhealthy scalp and follicles and dandruff. My dick had some infection and itched like hell. I also looked like shit too and was never prepared for events that forced me to go outside which made everything worse (I would hide and wait out people who potentially could see or interact with me, for example). I also was dirty and made my surroundings just as dirty, and I smelled bad, but luckily I don't have volatile BO.  *Anyways*, just saying that there are some serious consequences to poor hygiene that I wish someone told me about. Thanks mom."
"So long, zoloft. I finally got a prescription for something that isn't an ssri and doesn't have a mile long list of side effects.  Of course I had to wait until one relationship faded because of my lack of emotion and the next just died for other reasons. Fucking great.",changing medication and literally have to go cold turkey. These withdrawals are not fun
How do you open up about your depression and social anxiety to your family?. I have been thinking about telling my family that I have been suffering from depression but I don't really know what's the best way to let them know and have them understand what I'm going though. Can someone with past experience help me out? Thank you.,In my experience Telling my parents was the best thing I couldve done.I wasnt myself the past couple months and they knew something was up they are very supportive and want to help me get through my depression/anxiety go for it the first step to the road to recovery is admitting you need help.
Hello fellow depredditors.. What are your plans on getting through the next two weeks? I will be sitting alone in my house looking at the four walls. I might go outside and look at the happy couples for a while. What about you guys?,"be spending my time reading books. If in another world, I think about the real one."
My depression picked back up!. :) I'm hurting pretty badly.,Idk that :) made me smile haha
I fucking hate it here (job). I try to be nice and speak my mind. I always get rediculed or shunned. I seem to have less and less friends at work. I fucking hate it. I hate people. Of course it's probably me being too sensitive. I need to call that therapist in the new year...,"A therapist is never a bad idea.  Do you have the option to look for different work? How long have you been there? For myself, I need frequent change or things get stagnant and I get frustrated."
"Coworkers think depression is a jome and selfish, same with suicide. File grievance with HR?. Toxic work environment is toxic. I've already aired my grievances to my superiors. Is this a losing fight? HR always looks out for the company's best interest, which means money.","If pushing you to do it, yeah file a complaint. If they know suicidal and just their mindset, I see you benefiting from it at all. assuming in the USA."
How do i live help. i feel dead please help,What's on your mind? &lt;3
Wish I was never born. Not looking for attention or advice to look on the bright side just hoping to get some perspective on how I feel. And maybe what it means psychologically to feel this way. All of my life I've felt like the black sheep. I never fit in anywhere really. I wish I was never born. I feel like I haven't impacted anyone's life and if I did it was negative or non existent. I should feel like I have a purpose. I have been married 6 years two kids later but even then if I died tomo who would care? How would the world be different. I just spoke to my husband about(hoping to maybe get some comfort in knowing I impacted his life for the better?) this was his exact words were yeah well I see how you could think that that was it. It broke me and felt like it validated my point. This life feels life a prison. It feels worthless and sickening to know no matter where I go it does t really even matter. How many others feel this way????,"Yeah, I resonate with a lot of what you're saying. It's only on a place like here or a depression support group that you would find others that feel this way. Let me ask you this: what do you find joy or distraction in? Tell me everything you have tried."
I'm tired of fighting. I don't want to do it anymore. Doubt anyone will bother reading this anyway,Anything you want to talk about dude
Mirtazapine Fatigue. Anyone ever been on mirtazapine? I'm trying to adjust but the fatigue is killing me. I work nights but I feel like I can barely stand up. How long does it take to adjust?,"I'm on mirtazapine at the moment and, I too, am having issues dealing with the fatigue. I Spoke to my psychiatrist about it and they said that mirtazapine stimulates both an anti-histamine effect and a noroadrenaline effect. The anti-histamine effect causing the fatigue. However, once you start taking 30mg daily the noroadrenaline effect outweighs the anti-histamine effect and you should feel a lot less fatigue."
"Am I the only one?. So does anyone else have a problem with finding a reason to be sad, depressed or anxious. I find all the things finally working out and the my mind finding something for me to hate myself for.","It's confusing to feel like this a reason to feel like this. You seem to have multiple reasons to feel this way just according to your post/comment history. According to how you described your birthday and vacation, there are reasons you didn't enjoy them. If something sucks, it sucks. It's not your fault you don't enjoy something that sucks and shouldn't force yourself to try to enjoy something that sucks, because it won't stop sucking to you because you think that it shouldn't."
"I finally feel alive. I am in ecstasy, so much that tears started rolling down my eyes. I haven't felt like this in a long fucking time. I don't want it to fade, how can I keep this feeling?","Please, break out a diary and just write down every detail you can about how you feel and what you're thinking, if you still feel good, it'll help later."
"You used to be that guy that everyone like and now, you just seem broken. What's wrong?. Do I? Oh, I didn't really see it. Thanks for showing your concern but I'm fine.","Funny how pharases like that say everything you know, give an answer why you are depressed and then ask you why are depressed."
"Good quote: During the days I wait for night, During the nights I wait for morning. Not mine and I probably butchered it in translation, but perfectly describe the answer to that If you don't work or study, what do you do all day? question. I almost cried reading it.","Luckily, I'm content at night. Can lay in the dark and do nothing. It's peaceful"
"I took 20. I took 20 paracetamol about twelve hours ago, unsure what to do. I don't think I'm going to die. I doubt it. Any advice on what to do next?","It won't kill you definitely. You should be fine, but it's still harmful.  I would recommend visiting the hospital, especially if you feel bad.  Stay safe anyway, wish you all the best."
"Does anyone else get the feeling that everyone around you is living a fuller, happier, more complex life full of promise?. Everyone around me seems to be doing better; like happier, like they know something I or figured it out. I know everyone has their own problems, but everyone else overcomes theirs. I feel stuck; even when I make progress I feel slow, like behind everyone.","Well, if you looked at how those people spend their time. It would probably be very different than how you spend your time. So it kind of makes sense that they would have different results and resulting feelings about their life since their life is so different.  But the good news is, you can have a happy, fuller life too. What you should do is list out the top five things you don't like about your life. Then you should spend some time working on the one that is bothering you the most. In my experience, when I was unhappy with my life it was because I was neglecting some part of my life that was really nagging me.  Rooting for you! Hope this helps."
"I'm angry. I don't even know what I'm angry at, so just life I guess. I don't really have any motivation to do anything about it, so it's just sitting there inside me and I hate it.","I get angry at myself as well, along with all other negative Emotion and toxic feelings. Lately i have been trying to better myself by reading,and browsing subreddits like deciding to do better/get disciplined/get motivated. Some posts are really refreshing to read. Maybe you could try to find something to distract you. Learn a language or skill or something.  Spending time with friends. Make new friends. It is good that you have some long term friendship. short term friendship is not bad too.   Dont know if you do this or not. A mistake i made is that I used to watch a lot of comedy. Comedians would make a lot of self deprecating jokes, they would say things like : nobody likes them, they are unattractive, got terrible personalities, they have messed up life, blablabla in a very funny way. And i actually took it serious (by this i dont mean i get offend by jokes ) And proud that i am relate to that. So i always lookdown on myself. But i stopped doing that and try not to read posts on depression/ 2meirl /other sub that might bring me down."
i keep waking up feeling an overwhelming sense of loneliness. my dreams just seem so much better than reality at this point...  how's everyone else doing today?,Nightmares would even work. They increase my chance of getting killed and are just as meaningless as everything else.
"Not sure which is more depressing : looking ahead in life or looking back at the past. I dont want to be old. I dont want to grow. I just want to remain a child forever. Just innocent, gullible, carefree child.",the two are combined. The happy moments in the past breaking my heart while I have nothing to look forward to. No hope no prospects.
Girlfriend of three years broke up with me through a text because my depression is too much to deal with. There are no words for how I feel,"If any consolation, she probably cares about you a lot if she stayed with you for 3 years. got her own mental health to take care of, and okay. I hope it bring you down too much. This is a good opportunity for you to focus on your own mental health as well. not saying probable, but maybe she still likes you and would be willing to give it another try when/if you find ways to cope with your depression. take a lot of self introspection and time, however.  Stay strong. Get better. Take baby steps. get there when ready."
"People say stay strong, but it's not about strength, it's about endurance, and endurance always eventually runs out. Strength is for short bursts, endurance is for running races.","Great way of putting it. Life is just so exhausting. I can't leave the house without caffeine, I have no interests, I just feel like an empty battery. Hopefully one day you can find both strength and endurance."
why do i constantly cry for help and turn it down when i ACTUALLY get help. i feel like such an attention whore,"When I felt this way, I came to the conclusion that I didn't know who I was without these feelings. I didn't know what I liked anymore, would I be empty without this sadness? That sort of thought process, it was a lot of fear that drove me away from help. It's natural to be afraid of things changing. But when you feel ready to, these changes are for the better."
"Do you ever just walk with no purpose?. I've been doing so constantly, I ignore whatever's going on in my life for an hour or so and just walk. I walk and hope that when I get back everything will be better. But when I get home nothings changed, it's still filled with sadness. I don't know...","Yea this past summer ive not been up to much but walking a couple hours a day through my city. it's nice until I can't stop and keep telling myself, i'll go home at the next subway stop until 1 in the morning. A week or so ago I saw a movie an hour into a walk on a whim, and then walked another 3 hours, from the West Village to the Upper East Side"
"Where did my old self went?. I sat in front of the mirror today and stared at myself in the eyes while my tears are falling. The things is, I don't know who that girl is anymore.","Similar thing happened to me when I looked into the mirror a while back. I like to think that boy is just a home in his birth country. He came with me and my mum to another country, a new life but he didn't like it so he went back home."
"So today is the day I finally open up to a close friend. However I have no idea where to start, how to start or what to say, can any of you help?",Well I didn't sugar coat it just say it straight out. I don't see any other way of telling someone you trust and love.
"My parents found my stash of drugs that I use to cope with my depression. No drugs, Parents disowning me. I am seriously considering suicide.","That sucks, but believe me, self medicating only makes things worse."
"On my way to work feeling suicidal. I often find myself feeling suicidal during mornings. I sometimes feel like I could change things if I wanted to but... Holy cow, I feel so low, idea of not waking up sounds so freeing right now. I feel extremely irrelevant and lonely. Had to vent because it's so frequent",so sorry that you are going through this as well. Is there anyone you might be able to talk with? I know waking up in the morning with thoughts of suicide can just ruin a day. Maybe if able you can try to do something fun or relaxing when you get home. I know it probably help right now but maybe it can help ease the thoughts for a bit. I wish I knew something that you could do while at work but I sorry. If you want to talk feel free to pm me. also at work with the same thoughts.
Never been so close to ending it. I think this is the day I finally do it,"Same, we're all here for you, take a deep breath and talk to us!"
How do i know?. How do i know if im Hearing Voices?,I've dealt with not knowing if I'm hearing voices as well. What's your story and I'll share mine? Maybe we can help each other.
I never drink but I feel like drinking tonight to try and forget everything.. I'm from the UK. What drinks do people recommend?,I'd raise a glass with you but the doc warned against drinking with cymbalta.
Places. I like going places but after i go and an hour or so i wanna go home but when i come home i wanna go there again. :/,"Why do you go to that places? Why staying? I feel the same when I go dancing, I dance salsa, Bachata and kizomba (mostly) from 2 years, I go to the night, maybe that night is boring and I want to go home, but then I always find a reason to stay, the same I went there, dancing,feeling my self. So, why do you go there? Staying with friends? Being thoughtless?"
"Ever woke up and thought to yourself: Wow, I am such a sack of shit. That's me. Almost every day.","Replace sack of shit with failure and that's about right. I have no idea how so many people generally do well in their lives, you know - relationships, careers. I often think that it's an inevitability that some people are just meant to fail at everything throughout their lives as a way for the world to create a balance for all the successful, content people out there...an example of yin and yang in practice."
Anyone else here isolate themselves on purpose?. I do it as i don't believe i deserve to be happy.,"Yea, but it's not because I feel like I don't deserve happiness. I go through periods of isolation usually if I feel overwhelmed by life. I just need everything to stop. I also have suffered depression for about 20 years and know that it's not fun to be around me during a flare up. And during deep depression episodes I can't handle other people really."
How do you escape your thoughts?. Do people even find it possible to do so?,"I sleep, a lot. It actually takes practice to sleep a lot, the trick is to try your best not to wake up. You want to sleep long hours in one sitting, otherwise you will have problem falling asleep.  Nothing is better than sleep. Sometimes I dream, and regardless what I dream it's always better than reality."
dont want to be alive anymore. hate myself and i hate my life,Have you looked into therapy?
"you dont have to kill yourself. it will happen automatically in 70 to 90 years. enjoy this reality while you can, boys and girls","At least we don't have the horrid fear of our own mortality like non-depressives. I asked a question about aging and losing looks on another subreddit and most posted they didn't mind losing their looks but facing mortality was difficult. It really made me think, Wow, so there is an upside to depression. I look forward to dying."
my best and only friend IRL told me to fuck off because i was too negative .. i feel empty :( .,i don't know what to do i am feeling suicidal right now .
I just watched my dad fucking wave a stick at my mom and threaten to beat her and shut her out of the room.. They were all friendly a few minutes later.  What the fuck is wrong with people?  I'm in a nightmare.,Everything is wrong with people.
SRRIs making me feel terrible. First day of SRRIs.. Feel horrible. Should this be happening?,"Yeah, unfortunately the side effects from them can be really strong, especially if its your first time trying them, I lost a lot of sleep from stomach pains when I was first prescribed them. That said they side-effects should pass fairly quickly as your body adapts to the meds but if it is causing you a serious problem, talk to your doctor, they can often start you off on a smaller dosage and work their way up to a level that can help you."
"Extreme guilt causing me severe depression m29. The story is too long and in-depth to explain what happened. In the end, I hurt my best friend. the point is that I literally stop thinking about what I did to the point of pure exhaustion. Non stop Bad dreams. Fear. Guilt. Any advice? I am 29m","For past trauma, I found EMDR pretty effective. It's a technique used in therapy. It's basically designed for PTSD, which sounds like youre dealing with. That's all I can think of. Regardless, I hope you can get some solace."
"Anti depressants. Hey guys wanted to know your thoughts on anti depressants? What worked, what didn't, side effects and just any advice from experience.","was on fluoxetine (i think is how its spelt) for 9 years or so. definitely helped but i found that in a 2 week period im having 10 good days and then 4 severely bad days. so i quit them 9 months ago, best thing i did. it really clears your head to be off them. but by all means if you have the chance to try them, do it. thats just how i reacted with it. good luck mate."
I want to shoot myself. I don't want to die but I want to go to the hospital for weeks/months. And just lose contact with the world. Can anyone relate?,I had a choice of going to jail or being held for 3 days. I went to jail lol.
In a dark place. I feel at war with my own mind. I feel like my cause of death will eventually be suicide no matter what. I just don't think I can handle this. I hate myself.,"I've been here. I know it's hard to see past the dark clouds now and I know it's cheesy but it DOES get better. I've been in and out of psych wards for suicide attempts my entire life. Where I am now, what I've worked towards, has made everything I've gone through worth it. I am so glad I failed.   There is more to experience in this life than you could imagine and most difficult things are temporary and will pass. Hang in there. Work on yourself. Do the things that make you happy, make you feel something, as long as they aren't harmful. Spend time with your family, your friends or animals. Maybe with yourself or nature. Happiness really is in the little things."
I want to end it. But I'm too much of a wuss to end it,Pm me if ya wanna talk
"16 M , failure. I wish things were different. I have no friends due to social anxiety pushing myself away from everyone. I have no hobbies I am good at. I am not good at my college subjects. My mother passed away when I was 13. (16 now).","You are young and still have time to make something of yourself. The first step to feel better is to tell someone you trust. It can be a parent, grandparent or school counselor."
"Starting new meds and looking at about a month more of hell.. So I was getting ready to switch meds when I had to switch insurance. Old Dr wasn't covered anymore and it has taken almost 4 weeks to find a new one. During this time I got low enough to have a passive attempt at harming/killing myself because I was totally off meds. So today I get into the dr and get prescribed zoloft. Staring at the lowest dose and increasing by 25 MG a week. I asked if there was anything she could give me to help me now and she said no, I just have to tough it out. So fucking ruined by this. The whole system seems to be against people with depression. Any one have any ideas that can help me get through this?","Hate to say it, but it sounds like you might have a bad dr. One time during a depressive episode I happened to tell my dr everything that was going on with me (similar to your situation) he started me on a new medication but did not mess around with a lower dose. Just a thought, that maybe she shouldn't have started you on the lowest dose assuming she knew you had attempted, that is."
"My life feels like a living hell, no one speaks to me and all my family do is insult me. I can't cope anymore. I'm so sick of this shit. Every damn day someone in my family has something bad to say to me. I had my curtains opened and was in my room earlier and my christian grandmother shouted at me to close them. That's how petty she is. I told her I wanted them open and she started her usual name insulting. Then my mother returns home from her bf's house drunk and telling me I'm mental. Meanwhile no one has spoken to me all day, this is my life daily. Some days I wish I could take a cocktail of pills and just be fucking done with it.",Why would she want you to close the curtains?
maybe being introverted is a good thing. knowing less people means there are less people to hurt me,I guess it makes a person more defensive against other people but it really depends on the person? Some people enjoy being alone and some people can't stand it
"The alcohol doesn't work anymore, the girls make me feel more alone than before, all the drugs make me feel sick and sore, I've been tired since 2004, and I just want to go home.. Not really sure where that is though...","That's feels right there.. you sound like a sick and tired of being sick and tired situation.. You try any of the A's? In same place as you, totally understand. Not into the A's, but helps some people..."
"Summer BBQ and no one comes. Free ribs and booze and I have Js prerolled and yet all but one person is either a no show or forgot. Thanks world, thanks depression, FML.",who wouldnt want to show up to that?? they lame
"No reason to be depressed. I have no reason to feel this way right now. So many people are suffering through so much worse, and i feel like this. Fuck me","I feel the same way. At least I did for a while. I talked to my doctor a couple years ago and basically I learned that depression is a *mental illness* and you can literally have no reason to be depressed, like myself, and still feel like absolute shit and want to cry all the time. I'm pretty sure we were just born with it and you can only treat it. I myself am still trying to fight it but It's only been maybe like 8 years so I'm sure it will get better eventually. Just stay strong my dude. If you ever need anyone talk to you can PM me. I stay up all hours of the night on the east coast."
Drugs allow us to live in the past for a while... .. But the comeback to the present is brutal.  JAT,It's the otherway around man!
Every morning my first thoughts are about how terrible everything is and how much I hate myself.. I just automatically think about the one who hurt me and all the work I'm not doing and things that I'm scared of and how terrible I am and I hate this!!!! I can't sleep!!! I can't get my brain to shut up!!,"Same boat. It sucks. Hang in there cause it gets better for 99% of people!  Things that make me feel better:  -an episode of 'this american life'  -a walk around the block or hiking  -weed  -making music or drawing or just being creative  -journaling  -broad city  -talking about it. You have us, and there are therapy apps."
I’m terrified of committing suicide but I can’t stop thinking about it.. Almost daily I think about it because I see no other way out of my current life. It scares the shit out of me that I think about it so much.,"I feel you. I just about jumped off a building a few weeks back, it scares the shit out of me"
Hate texting. Type a long well thought out paragraph about your issues only to get met with one word or short stupid empty sentence and see what I mean....  Pointless,"Yea why I don't text anymore. All people want to hear is fake, surface, superficial shit."
If you had one wish.... What dream profession would you choose?,Always wanted to be painter. Unfortunately my drawings are not even worth. I do enjoy drawing and painting even though it is abysmal.
Depression is like an ex. Only comes back when doing better.,Or like an ex because a fucking pain in the ass.
That thought is back again.. The thought of dying and shidding myself,"had very violent and psychotic thoughts my whole life. been very violently raised and I know how to turn it off. But! What learned that makes me feel better is just thoughts. They go away. For us depressed, the thoughts have tighter grips on our conscious and therefore stick around longer. I say get busy doing something you like. Or go outside right now and sprint down the block. I promise, if you do that, feel better. I promise."
Hey at least I make myself laugh. at a point where unable to react to a situation without making some kind of sarcastic joke or comment. Probably not a healthy way to think but at least I can find some entertainment in my life.,"Laughter is a hugely important way of dealing with life, in my opinion.  Sometimes I also make myself laugh and realise life is not too bad afterall.  Keep finding the funny edge to everything and you can cope with anything."
Wish I would die soon and be reborn as a cat or a dog in a loving home.. Would love to have a loving home to be in.,"The thing that puts me off on reincarnation is that in the next few decades the quality of life on earth will probably tank pretty hard due to the effects of global warming. Granted, a cat or a dog would probably care very little about that  Being reborn in a different, better universe with magic abilities though? Hell yeah, give me that shit.  Eternal slumber is fine too tho"
"So depressed. I'm sitting here contemplating my reason for existence, and suicide. Please don't link me to sucidewatch it doesn't help any. I just wish I could have friends who stay longer then a couple days.","Well I'll be here if you'd like to talk, though I may be too young as I'm only 14, though I understand what your feeling &amp; it's terrible. Hopefully it'll get better for us sooner or later, anyway I wish you the best of luck"
"There are more two step authenticator messages in my phone logs than actual people. Well, there are no actual people there outside of my family members.","Yes. Another thing I can relate to. Had a small conversation with one close friend a few hours ago and having to watch my chat history in Whatsapp made me almost tear up. Aside from said friend, there are no real chats from the last days. The rest are from weeks ago, talking with people from college about stuff university-wise. That pretty much makes me hate looking at my phone. Or even more ..."
Fuck. When you try to relate but you'd rather kill yourself.,"hi there, forgive me if I'm wrong with regards to what you are referring to. How I understand your statement is that you try to relate to others but rather do the latter. If this is the case, I want to let you know that even though sometimes you feel you are compelled to relate to other because of societal pressures, you really don't and it depends to what extent. It's important to be who you are and be with people where you can be who you are. But that doesn't mean your depressed you is who you are as a person. Your depression is only a part of who you are, not your defining being. Don't define yourself as 'a depressed person' but more so 'a person that has depression right now at this stage of my life.' Because depression goes away or can be managed very well where it doesn't intrude on your life in a daily or constant basis. You are much more than your depression. Try to take smell steps that you are comfortable with and learn some coping strategies in managing depressed feelings. Ideally it'll be great if you can see a therapist but I understand that has it's own restrains. The key thing is to never give up on yourself because when you believe, there will be a way out of this. I always tell others that healing isn't easy but it's worth it because you are worth it, whether you feel it right now or not."
I wish the nukes had hit the earth.... So I can stop living life and finally be taken out of this world without suicide,"Same actually. But hopefully they wipe everybody out, because radiation is not fun for anybody"
Is sleep suppose to be better than being awake?. I have pretty much always like being asleep more than being awake except in the best days of my life. How do you feel about sleep? Would you rather be asleep or awake? Lately espically all I want to do is sleep.,"Yes, this is how my life is right now. Dreams that just torture. I honestly believe that humans were programmed to forget dreams.

Im so fucking tired of being alone. Why is love so complicated,"Life is like a wave. There are ups and downs. One day, no matter how hard been, your life will get better again. But until then, see all the bad stuff that is going on in your life as because in reality, there is no such thing as or You define if it is. Try to find the postive part in your current situation. There is always a reason, why some things happen. The reason is, to teach you a lesson.  For example: if you have no friends (like me), see it as negative. Try to find the lesson behind this experience. In this case, life wants to tell you, that loneliness is not what you, in your deepest self, want. You need persons such as friends around you. Take a desicion now, that you want to be lonely anymore, and life will listen to you and bring you friends again, and if it work, try to know, why it (i know the answer, but a bit complicated (msg me if you want to know)) and what the lesson in this experience is.  Also: Life is like a mirror. If you feel lonely inside, the outside world will deliver you that loneliness. pretty simple. So if you want to be lonely anymore, try not to feel lonely (i know fking hard, but you can reach that with more knowledge about the truth (msg me if you want to know more). If you feel lonely inside, that means, that the outside world will automaticlly deliver you NOT-loneliness, which means new persons will enter your life.   Oh also: Life is a paradox. right with love being complicated, but at the same time, the easiest thing you could possibly imagine.  If you understand something, just reply :)"

jobs. does anyone here know any way a freshman can get a job in california. im just hoping that getting a job and earning a little bit of money will help my depression to calm down or not be as severe.,"Freshman in high school or college? If HS, you can get a work permit at 15 I think. You're supposed to have one as long as you're working and under 18. As for finding one at that age most people I know went into food or retail. Coffee shops, fast food, some with cars did pizza delivery. Theaters usually higher younger people. They're simple jobs that don't require a lot of training and younger employees help keep younger crowds coming in. There should be someone at your school like a counselor with info on work permits.  Edit: its also great that you want to work. Having the money can give you more breathing room with bills and you can start building some retirement money. Plus having the experience will help get better jobs. Just remember you don't have to save everything. If all you do is work and your money goes right back out to food/bills/rent/etc, work will become a burden. Put aside a little bit each paycheck as a whatever fund. It wont be much at first but after a few months you'll have a good bit of change set aside. Wanna go for a weekend getaway? Do it. Looking for a new TV. Buy it. I usually set aside $100 month and typically buy something I'd wanted after a few months but couldn't normally justify. Worked out well. I still had some other money to go out to eat or do things, but I got a big reward every few months."

I myself had lost many people who meant the world to me, most of it due to me simply not being as important to them as they are to me. It's definitely taken a huge toll on me, but it's not the only reason why I suffer today.  I wonder sometimes because of this, perchance I get the love that I crave from the people that I cherish, would things be different? Would I be fixed?  I personally doubt that I would be fixed.

"I beat depression. You can too.. Persevere, it is worth the fight.","Because depression isn't the same for everyone, so there is no 'one size fits all' cure for everyone. And some of the things you mentioned can be downright harmful for some people. For instance, tough love can potentially push a suicidal person over the edge. There's a reason those things are mentioned in the sidebar. Treatment should be left to the professionals to deal with on an individual basis. This sub is more of a support group, meant for encouraging each other to hang on, to keep fighting, and to point people in the right direction if and when they seek professional help. I'm sincerely glad you beat depression. What worked for you, though, may not work for everyone else (or even anyone else). It's a very personal and individual experience. And that's where you should have gone with this submission. You should've just shared your story. Talked about your depression, talked about your journey through it and how you beat it. Instead, you rolled it out like a sales pitch for snake oil. This is dangerous territory, because when you say things like I beat depression and you can too, here's how..., you are selling people hope. If it doesn't work and somebody spirals down and harms themselves or worse, even in one single instance, you are at least partially to blame for selling them that false hope. Again, that's why we leave treatment to the professionals. Please, I can't stress enough that you follow the rules and guidelines in the sidebar. They are there for a reason."

Does it ever freak you out to realize that you’ll never be stable enough for a healthy relationship?. I see me having any romantic relationship &amp; getting married in the future. Been depressed and emotional my since my teen years. Medication doing me any miracles. Getting into a relationship is just a recipe for disaster at this point. Proven with my last failed 8 year relationship,"It's something that I've had to think long and hard about. I think I reached the conclusion that I simply wasn't good enough for a romantic relationship all the way back when I was twelve yeas old though, so I guess it really isn't something new. I'm in my early 20s. I think the fact that people my age are getting married left and right just kind of brings the issue to the forefront of my mind, but it doesn't really matter. Relationships and love are all bullshit anyways, just like pretty much everything in life. Maybe I just see things that way because I have had to experience life as myself. It's unfortunate, really."

My therapist tells me to make plans to hold myself accountable to go out. I won't tell you you need a god or give you advice. I'm content with loving you and grieving with you if you need that. Depression is strange and terrible because you don't always know why your grieving. That's ok. Most of all I want to tell you I love you.,"Dear Anna_rampage.  Thank you for your kind words.

The road to recovery takes a long time and is so much hard work, but when you get there everything will change. Seeing a doctor and getting antidepressants is the first step. The second step is finding something, ANYTHING, to get out of bed for. For me it was my cat. I would go without eating for days because I didn't want to leave my house, and I didn't want a delivery man to see the state of my house and myself. When my cat ran out of food I would suck it up and go to the store so he wouldn't be hungry. When he curled up with me I felt good, at a time that nothing else felt good. He passed a few months ago, but he flat out saved my life and I'm constantly grateful. Life can be overwhelming, especially when you feel the way you do. But you can make it better.

I hate him for making me collateral damage, &amp; not recognizing the fact that ruined 3 lives. I hate him for lifting me up and sucking all the beauty, happiness and bright life from my soul. I hate him for making a million promises, and not keeping one of them. I hate a man that took my undying, unwavering, unconditional, priceless love .. I hate a man that failed to return to me the faithfulness, respect and admiration I so boundlessly and freely gave to him. I hate this man that reached into my soul and crushed it with his bare hands into an oblivion..

In that situation she would benefit from distancing herself, as well as seeking professional counseling/therapy...But I digress.

No neurotic thinking or urgency to evaluate every thought going through the mind. Basically, you don't take yourself or life so personally or too seriously. You feel light, not heavy.

Don't make her talk, just let her talk. If she doesn't want to talk, don't leave, just sit there or lay there with her so she doesn't feel alone. When someone wants to die, they feel alone, they feel like no one cares. But you obviously care about her, so show it. Just be there for her.

If there was truly a god as religion describes it would do everything in its power to help its creation.. Not create such a physically and mentally flawed creation so susceptible to disease and psychological problems. And being this god created man in its own image that means this god is flawed and certainly not something I'd put my faith in.,"Religion is just really funny if you look at it from a certain point of view. If we are supposed to worship the being that created us and not turn away from it, why give us free will? Second thing, religion is about loving everything and everybody, but oh boy just try saying that you don't agree with them that there is an omni-potent being caring for people and they will start witch hunting against you.

Is it normal.... Is it normal to just get random moments of depression that makes you want break up every relationship you have ??,I disagree... I think depression is normal and so is wanting to fuck shit up because you feel like a turd. The hard part is trying to control those feelings.

Family history. Why do they ask if you have a family history of depression. How much of that is a factor to you getting it and why?,"Parents pass on their coping skills to their kids. If they have unhealthy ways of dealing with life, it's pretty likely their kids will have issues in that area too. This can be passed down from grandparents even. Also there is likely a genetic factor. But in my POV, I think it has to do with upbringing moreso."

Please help.. My girlfriend wants to kill her self. Extremely serious.,"Yes, I agree. As betrayal as it might feel you need to call for help. I didn't tell my friend's parents or our teachers about what kind of thoughts he told me he was having and now he's gone. This was years ago OP... That was betrayal. You don't want that. CALL and stay with her."
Drowning. Lately I've been drowning and can't seem to swim my way back above the water. One thing after another keeps pulling me down and I'm so close to the bottom I really don't know if I'll make it out alive.,"Keep treading. I suffered for years and suddenly I got better. I don't know how and it's not all a bed of roses, but I'm better. I couldn't catch a break and still shit seems to follow me around, but I'm better. Just keep treading."
I just found out she was cheating on me.. I feel numb. I want to die.,"Eff that thing, let's go for a beer and let her know she means nothing to you now.  Passive aggressive may not be the best, but I had a friend who did the same for me when I found out I was cheated on. He took me out to a bar, shot the shit with me and it really helped connecting with someone who cared enough to be there for me, I hope you've the same friends (if it fits your life style). I'm always down for a solid IPA!"
"Mom: Are you okay? You look sad. Me: Yeah. I'm fine... _I suppose I'm fucking fine if I sit against a door with my legs folded, arms on knees and head buried in arms._  She walked away, not saying a word. I wasn't looking at her. I wasn't even feeling insecure. _I feel like an idiot. Why do I have to be such a coward.._",Because saying yeah I'm fine takes less effort than explaining how you really feel.

Telling people the reason why I’m missing school is because of my depression is extremely uncomfortable. Just reminds me that im not normal.,Are you in high school or college? How are you getting around not getting kicked out due to absences (if high school).

I should feel happy, i should be bouncing off the walls with excitement, but i just feel empty.",why don't you actually respond to posts? Clearly you are not here to talk if you won't actually talk when someone already initiates conversation on the post.
The cruelest thing you can do to a person is give them hope. And then snatch it away.,"So true. Every time I think I've made a friend, a few weeks/months later, life is like, haha, gotcha! At this point I don't like trying. I want to cut off everyone (not that I have to try that hard, lol) and just be alone, but then when loneliness gets to me, it hurts physically and I hate that."
"Advice on how to date a depressed person?. I am in love with my boyfriend for him. Unfortunately, he has battled depression long before me. I love him, but loving him can be so hard. It hurts when he becomes distant when his emotions become overwhelming. It hurts when he becomes upset. I know he is going through an extremely tough mental battle, so I refrain from telling him my thoughts. I have got him to seek help (antidepressants). He has begun opening up to his friends and family. I am very happy for him! I am proud of how far he has progressed. He loves me a lot, and depends on me for his hapiness. It is difficult making him happy when his depression is taking a toll on me. I have sacrificed so much of my hapiness for him, and all in the name of love. Right now, he is spending time with his friends and BEING HAPPY while I am at home worrying about him and thinking of ways in which I can be a better girlfriend. I am choosing to prioritize his emotions over mine because he is a good person who deserves to happy. Any advice on dating a depressed person?","Dating a depressed person is like dating a child with temper tantrums. I suggest you to focus on your own happiness first, then be there to support them when they need you. You are ultimately two individuals with individual needs and ideals. Live and let live, support and be supported are the key. You are at this point just dating and you must remember that you shouldn't give more than what you must. It should be a harmony where equal emotional exchange is the mandate. Otherwise it takes a toll lime it is right now and if things go sour it will be your fault and you are bound to hurt the most because you gave more than you had and got lesser in return. Balance is key, communication is the order. Respect and understanding is the borderline"
"Does anyone else get depressed after/while reading a romantic story because you just feel so unlovable and hopeless. Bc I do, and I want to relate to someone desperately",I dont read romantic books but this is why I hate romantic movies/shows
Pay attention to those little jokes your friends make about you. Those little funny shots are how they really feel and the lowkey hate. I read this quote on the internet today and realised how true it is P.S. This quote is not mine.I saw it on Instagram,"The amount of plumber and garbage man jokes they made about me when I told them I wasn't going to uni. Fucking hell, and they blatantly laughed for minutes on end while i was faking my own. And they would bring it up at least once every time they fucking saw me. oh we were just joking man cmon when I jokingly but not so jokingly said I was going to kill myself. Glad I cut off ties with them. Made my depression like 5 times worse during that period. Still hurts. Were my only friends"
I think tonight is the night.... ... I just take it anymore.,I am guilty that I just want to find my own night but all I can say is I hope you make it through one more night. I don't know why.

i haven't spent less than 16 hours a day in bed in the past two weeks.. i'm so tired. i try to get up and do things and that helps but only for a little bit then i'm worn out again. on the plus side i've caught up on a lot of anime.,Sounds like you're in the midst of an episode. For me only time could help until I was (mentally) strong enough to get out of bed to my doc. YouTube in bed helped passed the time. Not sure if it was healthiest thing though.
Can my doctor hospitalise me.. I live in Australia and over the age of 18. If i tell my doctor that i want to kill myself and have a plan and note can they hospitalise me,"If it's anything like here in New York, walk into an emergency room and tell them you're there because you want to kill your self. That's probably the easiest fastest way, since you'll probably have to wait to talk to your doctor."
Can you ever be successful?. I'm sure my depression will never go away. When I was 16 I always had high dreams and wanted to be successful. Currently in my engineering degree and I have failed physics twice. Is depression and success not compatible?,The thoughts that you're associating with depression will not go away as a result of what you associate with success. If depression is getting in the way of your success than the most succesful thing you can do is to find peace with your depression. The rest will fall into place :)

"Anxiety just makes Depression worse. You get anxious over something, like being excluded. You constantly think about being excluded right now, then you think of the great times they are having, and all the shit they are saying about you. So you become depressed. Having anxiety and depression is the worst. Anyone else understand?","I understand but I can't directly help you. I'd say find just one person you can talk to. Having depression AND anxiety is a double slam because (in my case) anxiety and depression are almost the same...it's hard to tell the difference. I'm older than dirt and could give you some advice, but I'll just say: try not to be alone and talk to someone that you can be honest with. Good luck."

Therefore, it's really sad to see the few friendships you've managed to build up over years slowly fade to black.

I'm left alone, where no one notices. My life has boiled down to getting a plethora of acquaintances, but not a single friend. Everyone knows who I am, but no one knows how I am.

Feels like depression is contagious. Feels like I get home and everybody's chipper mood begins to plummet. It's like I am sapping their life away.

No money i am absolutely worthless... but i dont want to hurt the few who still care about me. My brothers helped me a lot and it would be unfair for to just commit suicide... how can overcome this situation,"you forgot, you still have yourself. you're not worthless just because you don't have any money. don't stay for your brothers. stay for yourself. this sounds but there is stuff worth staying for. the shitty truth is if we kill ourselves, people mourn for a day, then move on and forget us. our life briefly becomes a public spectacle. people spout shit like ohh what a sweet person, shame they died. they won't say that they were the ones who ignored us when we were alive and suffering. THEY WILL FORGET YOU. so stay the fuck alive, and make them notice you because you deserve to be noticed. worthlessness usually stems from lack of accomplishment. if that applies to you, start learning or doing something. anything that interests you. just give it your all. but don't die just yet. you will, eventually, so why hurry. so for now, look in the mirror every time you feel you're alone, and remind yourself you're not."

The difference between good and bad days is starting to get to me.. Before I would just assume the next day would be shit and in some weird way I was content with it. Now that I'm actually making an effort to better myself I now feel happier and but way more depressed at the same time.,"Do you mean your bad days feel worse or do you mean you feel bad and good at the same time?  Ever since this thing started for me I had fluctuations over the course of the day, days and weeks, where I would have lethargy, tiredness and depression in the mornings for example and then good feelings and even excitement and a lot of energy in the evenings. Also I have very good days/ weeks and suddenly it hits me again.  Did you have constant depression and how bad was it?"
I don't think I'm fit for school. It means a lot to me but I just can't motivate myself or concentrate,I was one year in collage but I realize that I didn't like how we studied there.

"Has anyone with depression used a (prescribed) stimulant with any success?. I was watching a new documentary on Netflix about Adderall and other related drugs and almost everyone on it described how amazing they felt while being on it. They felt focused, motivated, and just generally like the best version of themselves.  I have clinical depression and anxiety. In the past, doctors have said Adderall could/would possibly heighten anxiety, but, I'm so unmotivated and blah all the time from my depression, I could really use a leg up.  Anyone have experience taking it that's in a similar situation?","i know if it could be considered a stimulant, but i take sertraline for my depression and i get fair results. I also used to take vyvanse in combination with sertraline but i must warn against it. It usually left me numb and unable to enjoy anything."
I have no clue. The fact that I have no one to communicate my problems and mental harm with on a personal level should crush me and leave me crying but I'm just empty and frustrated.,I feel the same way and I guess kind of teach myself to just breakdown and cry when I get too overwhelmed with those kinds of feelings

Just be happy. Sure.. I'll get right on it..,"Lmao, I love it when my asshole father tells me this. Yeah, it really helps. **Like I didn't try THAT for the past 4 years.**"
I feel so misunderstood. Why nobody seems to understand in pain and what going through? Living is not that easy :( I think I kinda wanna die ...,"Hi friend! :) I'm really sorry you're in such pain :( sometimes the people we have around us can't see the pain we're in because they don't want to (they may see it, not know how to help us, and are afraid to because it may cause them pain).  This may seem like useless advice, but it can greatly help if you tell the other people exactly how you're feeling and ask them to try and help you. Nobody will ever be inside your head and able to experience exactly what you are feeling, but by talking to them and letting them know, you can help them to understand you. Sometimes we have to do the hardest part of reaching out ourselves. I had to tell my best friend I was feeling suicidal, but by telling her she helped me turn my life around. She just didn't realise. It's never easy to do, but I can promise you that you are so much stronger than you know, and there are always people willing to listen and to try to understand what you're going through.  Lastly, I hope you don't die. Not until you've been able to live the life that you want, the life that you deserve to have. I'm sending you love and luck."

"Caring only makes you weak.. They think you care, they'll walk all over you.",This is really true. I showed that i cared about 2 friends at school (2 girls) and now they think they can make me do everything. It makes me really sad because i feel being used by everyone
Can someone have a chat with me for a bit?. I feel so sad and lonely,I'm around if you need someone to chat with. I'm sorry you're feeling sad. Sometimes it's such a painful and unbearable feeling.
Question. Does anyone else struggle to make sure their depression is justified? Sometimes I think alright to feel this way and working through it and others I feel like Im making the issues up in my head.,Same honestly. Half the time I feel like overreacting and because of that I feel like a little bitch which brings me down more.
does anyone else get the feeling.... when you just ache on the inside like something's missing but you don't know what. and all you can do is smile through it because...what else is there,I feel like this all the time and I am never sure what I am looking for. I really wish I had a passion in life like some people have. Sadly I have not found it yet. I never felt that strongly about anything.  Maybe I need girlfriend.Maybe I just need more friends. Maybe I need a different job.Maybe I need to to work things out with my farther. Or maybe I just need to be able to really talk to someone.
One of these days. I swear one of these days I'm going to go fucking crazy from not having my anxiety and depression treated. Probably be able to kill myself then. Hooray.,Why cant you get it treated? (excuse my ignorance)

Life is shit.,summed up my feelings in a few sentences. Every. Single. Waking moment. Is shit. Hobbies help. Exercise help. Talking to friends is now a chore. literally all shit.
Does anyone know how to study when they're depressed?. I can't find the strength to do anything. It's almost as if my mind has turned off.,"That has to be tough.  It's different strokes for different folks of course but I might have a suggestion. I find my depression tends to be racing negative thoughts. My understanding is that there are two default brain modes, one is random thought, day dreaming for example, and the other is processing. So you need to switch from day dreaming to processing, and that is hard for everyone. Start with meditation. Close your eyes for 5min and focus on your breathing. If your thoughts drift from breathing, then shut it down n snap back to breathing. Don't get emotional, just stay calm and focus on breathing. When finished, move everything that is a distraction away from you. No phone, no internet if possible, just clear that shit away and start studying as if it is your breathing. This focus is just like a muscle and the more you flex the stronger it will become. Don't expect to focus for hours on end, but try to catch yourself when you drift and get back to that focus.  Also make studying fun, or less boring. Take notes, highlight pages, repeat the things you read. Most importantly, try telling a story with what you are learning. It's a strong method for memorization. People with ordinary memories use stories and codes to memorize full decks of cards in minutes. Good luck!"

Bad evening. toddler cut her own hair.,It may suck in hindsight. But her hair will grow back and you'll have a story to tell. It happens. You have to look at kids as things of wonder.

Is having friends really this important?. There's always people saying life is nothing without friends or stuff like that. As someone who isn't even trying to look for a friend this is quite sad. Are you saying im living a worthless pathetic life?,"I have to be honest with you, because it's very important: I believe friends are very important. But it's extremely hard to make friends, I know. But talking to people about how you feel helps alot, it does with me. It gives me purpose, dreams and hope. Friends can come from anywhere at any time. If you ever want to let off some steam, bounce something off another person or seek advice, never hesitate to write to me. I'm your friend, and I'll never let anything happen to you, if I can help it. Please talk to me if you need it, it can save lives, in more ways than you'd think.  Have a very merry Christmas, know you are not alone."
I.... just always depressed.. I ever think doing the right thing.,Me too..depression clouds our judgment. It gets really hard to think about things clearly. Hate this feeling but it won't go away yet.
Today as I was walking home I stopped to lay on the grass for a while. It was nice.

Losing all hope.. I've been depressed for few years now but I've always had hope that I will get better and get rid of it.

I just got fired again. I keep a job fuck me,There are many services that local and state governments provide to help people such as yourself find work. The cool thing is they are totally free and they can provide a support system and will work with you to find a job that works for you! I would suggest looking online for these services and sending your information to them. Stay strong and I love you!!
"There is no escape from the loneliness. If no woman wants to date you, no woman wants to date you, and no amount of diet and exercise changes it. I get blocked for saying hello... all my family grew old and died. All my friends got married and moved away. I live in hell, alone.",I feel alone also.

"My girlfriend left me. I had a crush on this one girl for a couple months, and today my dream came true; she asked me out. Of course I said yes. Then, I shit you not, 45 fucking minutes after, I get a text from her basically saying that someone else she liked more than me asked her out and that she was leaving me for them. Do you ever just feel like you're not meant to have anyone special, or even anyone at all? She was one of my only friends, and she just left me in the dirt.","Yeah, I have to agree, she sounds like an absolute moron. In some ways, I realise this isn't gonna be easy for you to believe yourself, but it may even be helpful that this has come out because it sounds like she just wouldn't have been a reliable friend.  There are other (much better) people out there. Just try not to actively worry about it too much, or really try and find someone, just let it happen if it happens, and if not, don't fret about it."

crying myself to sleep day #16. I dont think its gonna change anytime soon huh...,"i read a thing a while back... to paraphrase (badly): Most people think that depressed people are bad at regulating their emotions. But actually, depressed people are great at regulating their emotions; they just always regulate them toward depression. ...When i first read this, i was sitting alone in the dark at 2am listening to Elliot Smith. So, it rang true. It's super hard to do, but if you can force yourself to change your habits (even slightly), your brain actually physically changes with practice."

can’t go to school anymore. i been to college in weeks because i just have no motivation to go. i know i should go but i just care anymore. i care about my future anymore. everything feels so pointless and struggling to find any reason to live,"I remember when I was in a deep stage of depression I always begged my mother to let me stay home. Even when she drove me to school, I would catch a bus to the shops and ditch school. (Never got caught hehe) Anyway, I just felt so.. bored of school and so sick of all the shit that went down there. Instead, I decided to live my life, have fun, sleep, ditch school or do whatever and just live the life as I wanted to. If you cant find motivation in one thing, than find motivation in another. After all we're all gonna die one day, live your life as you want."

Currently on Lexapro sub and going to be prescribed Wellbutrin. Anyone been on this combo before?. I am currently taking Lexapro once a day and my doc just prescribed me Wellbutrin. I was just wondering if anyone has ever been on this combo before. I am currently on Lexapro for Depression and Anxiety. My depression is becoming less manageable the longer I am on Lexapro. I am also tired all of the time. I am scared to try any other SSRI's as they have really messed with my libido in the past. My doctor suggested Wellbutrin but I am a little worried about how I will react to it. Just wanted to come here and see if anyone has taken both and what your experience was ?,"I was on Lexapro and Wellbutrin for the longest time and didn't have any bad side effects, but it definitely didn't help me as much as I'd hoped. It did get me from I can't leave my bed to I guess I can function occasionally on a good day. I'm no longer on the Lexapro but the Wellbutrin has stuck with me for a while, so. It went well for me; Hope it goes well for you!"

"Self help without professional treatment. Hi, I believe that I may have major depressive disorder. I am going into college this coming fall and do not have the funds or time to seek professional help since school is coming so soon. What can I do to improve my life for the time being? Every day I face a lack of motivation, feelings of hopelessness, general sadness, and overall lethargy and laziness. Nothing I do motivates me and every time I try and do something I give up halfway through and never return to what I was doing.","I would say plan around your depression. You gotta give yourself more time to do stuff because there will be days where you just do work. If on average you give yourself 2 weeks to do a paper, give yourself 3 weeks and push yourself to work when you have good days.  Know that going to be tiring to try to work as soon as your depression temporarily lifts and just take things in small increments. Write a paragraph a day for 3 weeks and or write two paragraphs when you miss a day due to depression and voila! Same results, different pace, depression included and worked around. Practice self care and indulge in the fee things that make you feel okay. stay in your dorm/apartment constantly. Seriously, even if you go to the library for a few hours a day, it helps with isolation.  If you like to write, start roleplays with people on geeking or rolemance and reply when you need a break from academic writing. Otherwise indulge in low energy hobbies. And try to eat 2 meals a day even when you feel like it. It makes a difference.  Overall, the transition is going to be rough and even more rough for you because of depression so try not to get stuck in a loop of bad habits. Break your routine if not making you feel good and professors are more understanding than not about late assignments and group projects. Be candid with them. Tell them you have the disability accommodations et but working on them.  Good luck!!!"
I am wasting my life trying to please people who treat me like shit. I decided to cut contact with all my friends because of this. Now only my parents remain.,Good idea.

Other days it's just there the entire time. It's tiring.

For my antidepressant, I tried lexapro ( which i stopped taking; because, it made my dick stop working), and wellbutrin.. which was alright. My antipsychotic was risperidone.. which I honestly am still dealing with a side affect of it till this day. I'll be honest, I took those combination of drugs for like 2.5 years, and just stopped. I learned how to deal with the symptoms a lot better than I did from years prior.. looking back.. thst could've gone poorly. I'd recommend being open in discussion with your psychiatrist about the effects these drugs are having on your body and your mood. There are quite a few drug combinations for this type of diagnosis, and it would be wise to work dilligently with your psychiatrist until you find the combination for you. Don't be afraid of them changing your meds. They aren't work anyway, so you may as well be open to working with professionals to find something that works for you and your body. I'd also recommend to try being aware as possible if the symptoms, the triggers for those symptoms, and look to grow from them even while on these medications. Keep a close eye out for unwanted side effects. A lot of the medicines they may try to prescribe would require regular schedules blood work. I'll be honest, I did the irresponsible thing and ended up just not taking them. I got tired of taking medicine at that point; because, I had been taking it all my life. Whether it was for childhood epilepsy, ADHD, depression, and the last diagnosis cyclothymia. Was hospitalized twice before I got the cyclothymia diagnosis, and it was pretty bad at one point, and looking back.. I'm really lucky I didn't mess myself up by just stopping cold turkey. Work with your psychiatrist and maybe even work with a therapist if you can. Do all you can do to find the proper treatment, and YOU WILL BE OKAY. You are not"
How do you manage to be happy with a full time job?. There's nothing I would ever do 8 hours a day voluntarily. How does one make this bearable?,Sometimes it's not a matter of choice. But if one stays open for opportunities... sometimes one comes along.

I'm drunk and fuck and want to die. For real is the secret.to suicide getting drunk? I gotta do this eventually,"A lot of people turn to drinking alcohol to escape from feeling shit, to feel better or feel like nothing matters, the first 2 maybe 3 drinks kind of gives us a 'who cares' attitude, but when we keep drinking, it does make us feel more vulnerable and fragile, making us emotionally worse, Ive done this many times.

Things will get better. Things never fucking get better,"You change, life changes. 10+ years since my diagnose (I'm still young by the way). Most likely much longer though.

How do you learn to accept what you cant change?. Trying to stop self loath,"You help it. I've always told myself that when something is bad, either change it or deal with it. I mostly used it all my mother who is pretty fat and puts down other people for being fat. When something can't be changed, the problem is not that you must deal with it, but that you don't know how to. Focus your thoughts on how to better the situation, maybe take advantage of it even."
"What is the excuse you usually use to hide it?. Every now and then when someone notices something, I just say that I'm feeling tired and didn't get some sleep, or that I had something else to do.
